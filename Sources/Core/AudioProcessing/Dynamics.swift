///   • `peak`    — instant attack, fast release (`peakReleaseMs`): catches a 1-sample spike.
///   • `slowEnv` — the speech background (slow attack/release).
///   • trip when `peak > clickRatio · slowEnv`.
/// A wall-clock EVENT LATCH separates clicks from sustained content: a trip starts an event
/// and refreshes a hold that bridges sub-pitch-period gaps (so a periodic loud passage reads
/// as ONE event, not a train of clicks). If the event outlasts `maxClickMs` it LATCHES OFF —
/// the rise is voiced content, gain snaps to unity and stays there until a real quiet gap ends
/// the event. So even an extreme instantaneous level jump only ducks for ≈`maxClickMs`, while a
/// genuine click (a shorter event) is fully ducked. Attack to the floor is instantaneous (the
/// step is masked by the click transient); release is a smooth ramp (`releaseMs`) — no zipper.
///
/// **Identity at rest is non-negotiable: the gate NEVER fires from cold silence, and re-disarms
/// on any realistic pause.** A click is only meaningful relative to an ESTABLISHED background, so
/// the gate arms only after the slow background has stayed above `minThresholdLin` continuously for
/// `warmupSamples` (one slow-release time-constant). Disarm is driven by an INDEPENDENT
/// instantaneous-silence detector, NOT by `slowEnv`: `slowEnv` releases over ~200 ms, so a realistic
/// 200–300 ms pause leaves it above the floor (it must NOT gate disarm). A `silenceCounter` counts
/// consecutive samples whose instantaneous level `|x|` is below the floor; after `silenceSamples`
/// (≈75 ms) the gate force-disarms (`warmupCounter = 0`). Any above-floor sample resets it, so voiced
/// zero-crossings never disarm mid-speech. While unarmed, `process` returns `x` BIT-EXACTLY (`gain`
/// held at 1.0; the ratio is never even consulted), so a voiced onset after silence is exact identity
/// from sample 0 — at cold start AND after every realistic pause.
///
/// **Documented tradeoff:** a click occurring from *total* silence (no preceding speech to establish
/// a background) is intentionally MISSED — missing a from-silence click is strictly preferable to
/// dulling a clean voiced onset. Clicks during or after speech (the realistic case) still have an
/// established background and are caught.
///
/// Below the ratio (and when disabled) `gain = 1.0` exactly.
///
/// **State-carry contract (mirrors `DeEsser`):** `configure(enabled: true)` updates
/// parameters/coefficients ONLY — it MUST NOT clear the runtime detector state (`peak`, `slowEnv`,
/// `gain`, `holdCounter`, `eventLen`, `elevatedHold`, `latched`, `warmupCounter`, `silenceCounter`).
/// Runtime state is cleared ONLY by `reset()` and by the disabled arm. `VoiceChain` decides when to

/// Adaptive-threshold downward expander ("voice gate") for headset-mic use: while the wearer is
/// NOT speaking, other people's voices also picked up by the mic are attenuated. DeepFilterNet
/// keeps all speech energy intact, so this stage runs AFTER the DFN output and decides purely
/// from LEVEL — it has no notion of speaker identity, only of loudness relative to the wearer's
/// own established speaking level.
///
/// Per-sample algorithm:
///   1. `env` — a one-pole follower of `abs(x)` (fast `envAttackMs` rise / `envReleaseMs` fall),
///      converted to `envDb = 20·log10(env)`: the instantaneous loudness estimate.
///   2. `peakDb` — a SLOW one-pole follower of `envDb` (`peakAttackMs` rise / very slow
///      `peakReleaseMs` fall, starts at −100 dB). With a headset mic the wearer is reliably the
///      loudest talker, so this converges on and holds the WEARER's speaking level — the very
///      slow release means a quiet stretch (someone else talking, or silence) doesn't erode it.
///   3. `openDb = max(absoluteFloorDb, peakDb − marginDb)`; `closeDb = openDb − hysteresisDb`.
///      Hysteresis keeps the gate from chattering right at the boundary.
///   4. A hold-based state machine (`closed` → `open` → `hold` → `closed`) requires the envelope
///      to stay below `closeDb` for `holdMs` before the gate actually closes, so a brief dip
///      inside the wearer's own speech (a pause between words) doesn't clip the next syllable.
///      While `.hold`, an envelope back above `closeDb` returns to `.open` and cancels the close.
///   5. Gain target is 0 dB in `.open`/`.hold`, `floorDb` in `.closed`; smoothed IN THE DB DOMAIN
///      (mirrors `Compressor.envDb`) — `gainDb` one-pole toward the target (`attackMs` while
///      rising/opening, `releaseMs` while falling/closing) — then converted with
///      `gain = 10^(gainDb/20)` and applied as `x * gain`. Smoothing in dB (not linear gain) makes
///      the release rate a constant dB/s regardless of how deep `floorDb` is, so a shallow floor
///      (e.g. Low's −15 dB) and a deep floor (High's −60 dB) settle in the same number of
///      `releaseMs` time constants instead of the deep floor taking many times longer.
///
/// **Attenuation-only:** `gainDb` is always in `[floorDb, 0]` — this stage never raises level, so
/// it must not (and does not) pull in the shared voice-chain limiter (see `VoiceChain.process`).
///
/// **Carry-state contract (mirrors `DeEsser`/`DePlosive`/`DeClick`):** `configure(enabled: true)`
/// updates coefficients/thresholds ONLY — it never clears runtime state (`env`, `peakDb`, `state`,
/// `holdCounter`, `gainDb`). Only `reset()` and the disabled arm clear it, so an unrelated
/// reconfigure (e.g. a different setting layered on the same chain) is bumpless.
///
/// **Documented caveat:** this is a level-based gate, not a diarization system. It does NOT
/// remove another talker's voice WHILE the wearer is also speaking — both pass together once the
/// combined level is above the open threshold.
