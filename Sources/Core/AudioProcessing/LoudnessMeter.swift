/// the RLB high-pass (≈ −3 dB at ~38 Hz). Both use the STANDARD's published 48 kHz

/// calibration offset. Integrated loudness is gated (absolute −70 LUFS + relative
/// −10 LU) over a fixed-size, pre-allocated block ring (no render-path allocation).

/// Sample-peak is tracked alongside (NOT certified true-peak — see CONCEPTS.md;
/// oversampled dBTP is deferred for the Apple-Silicon perf mandate).
