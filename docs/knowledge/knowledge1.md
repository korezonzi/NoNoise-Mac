### [DECISION] 2026-06-15 — Incoming engine lifecycle is truthful: retain ONLY a genuinely-running pipeline (@Valsaraj)
- **Problem:** A `start()` that returned `Void` (or always "succeeded") let `AudioModel` retain the engine even when capture attach failed, when the monitor couldn't be pinned, or when `AVAudioEngine.start()` threw (the error was swallowed). Result: the SECOND `DeepFilterNetDSP` (CoreML) pipeline stayed resident — burning ANE/CPU/memory — while producing NO audible output (a false-positive "started"), breaking the zero-cost-when-off mandate. Separately, a hardware change (unplugging the loopback/monitor) left a stale engine running against a vanished device because the refresh path never re-validated it.
- **Decision:** `IncomingCleanupEngine.start()` returns `Bool` and is truthful — `true` ONLY after capture attaches AND the monitor pins (`AudioUnitSetProperty(...CurrentDevice) == noErr`) AND `engine.start()` succeeds; capture is kicked off only AFTER playback is confirmed live; any failure calls `stop()` and returns `false`. `applyIncomingCleanup()` assigns `incomingEngine = engine` ONLY on a `true` start (else `stop()` + `nil`). `refreshDevicesAfterHardwareChange()` re-runs `applyIncomingCleanup()` (HAL-direct validation, independent of the async-published picker arrays) to tear down vanished selections or restart recovered ones. `stop()`'s guard also covers the attached-but-idle state (`!captureSession.inputs.isEmpty`) so the playback-failure path tears down deterministically instead of relying on dealloc.
- **Rule:** A lazily-owned heavy engine must report start success truthfully (graph actually live, not merely constructed); the owner must retain it ONLY on a `true` start AND re-validate on hardware changes — otherwise a half-open pipeline silently leaks ANE/CPU/memory.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/IncomingCleanupEngine.swift` (`start`, `stop`, `configureCapture`, `configurePlayback`), `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift` (`applyIncomingCleanup`, `refreshDevicesAfterHardwareChange`).

### [GOTCHA] 2026-06-15 — CoreAudio channel capability must be SUMMED, not inferred from data size (@Valsaraj)
- **Symptom:** With the incoming/guest picker, an input-only mic could be offered as a "monitor output" (and an output-only device as an incoming source); pure predicate tests still passed because they inject `hasInput`/`hasOutput` directly.
- **Root Cause:** `deviceInfo(for:)` detected capability with `AudioObjectGetPropertyDataSize(kAudioDevicePropertyStreamConfiguration) > 0`. That property returns a non-empty `AudioBufferList` header even when a scope has ZERO streams (`mNumberBuffers == 0`), so `size > 0` reports phantom channels. (The pre-existing `fetchOutputDevices` used the same shortcut; promoting it to shared input+output classification made it load-bearing and wrong.)
- **Fix/Rule:** Read the full `AudioBufferList` and SUM `mBuffers[*].mNumberChannels`; treat a scope as capable only when the sum is `> 0`. Never use the property data size as a channel-count proxy. This can only *fix* classification — a real device always has ≥1 channel in its scope.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift` (`deviceInfo(for:)` → `channelCount(scope:)`).

### [DECISION] 2026-06-15 — Incoming cleanup refuses to run without a chosen REAL monitor (feedback guard) (@Valsaraj)
- **Problem:** If the engine started with no monitor selected (`incomingOutputDeviceID == 0`), `configurePlayback` fell through to AVAudioEngine's system DEFAULT output. The setup instructs users to point the call app's speaker at a loopback (BlackHole) — which is often the system default — so cleaned audio replayed to the default could loop straight back into the captured source: a feedback path.
- **Decision:** `applyIncomingCleanup()` constructs/starts the engine ONLY when enabled with BOTH a source AND a monitor that each re-pass the canonical predicates (`isSelectableIncomingSource` / `isSelectableMonitorOutput`) and `incomingOutputDeviceID != 0`; otherwise it tears down to `nil`. "No valid monitor" means "do not run" — never "fall back to default". `IncomingCleanupEngine.start()` also bails (no playback graph) if the source can't be attached. UI: the "Hear on" picker has an explicit "Select…" (`tag(0)`) state.
- **Rule:** A render path that plays to a user-chosen device must validate that device (and refuse to run) rather than silently falling back to the system default — especially when a loopback is in the signal chain.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift` (`applyIncomingCleanup`), `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/IncomingCleanupEngine.swift` (`start`, `configureCapture`), `Sources/App/SettingsView.swift`, `Sources/App/ContentView.swift`.

### [DECISION] 2026-06-15 — Incoming/guest cleanup is a SEPARATE engine, not a second AudioModel (@Valsaraj)
- **Problem:** Cleaning the *other* side of a call (a noisy guest) is the mirror of mic cleaning, so it's tempting to reuse `AudioModel` or its render path.
- **Decision:** Ship a standalone `IncomingCleanupEngine` that owns its OWN `AVCaptureSession`, `AVAudioEngine`, `RingBuffer`, and `DeepFilterNetDSP`. It must NOT touch the mic path or the NoNoise Mic sink, and it runs DeepFilterNet **only** — no `VoiceChain`/Broadcast Voice (that polish is voice-shaping for the outgoing mic, wrong for arbitrary guest audio). Keeps the two pipelines independently startable and avoids coupling render-thread state.
- **Rule:** A second cleaning pipeline gets its own engine + its own DSP instance (own recurrent state). Never share DeepFilterNet streaming state between the mic and incoming paths.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/IncomingCleanupEngine.swift`, `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift`.

### [DECISION] 2026-06-15 — Incoming engine is a lazy-OWNED optional, off by default (zero-cost when off) (@Valsaraj)
- **Problem:** `DeepFilterNetDSP.init()` allocates ML buffers and async-loads the CoreML model. A stored `let` incoming engine would pay that cost at launch even for users who never clean incoming audio.
- **Decision:** `AudioModel` holds `IncomingCleanupEngine?` (OPTIONAL, never a stored `let`). `applyIncomingCleanup()` CREATES it on the enabled transition and releases it to `nil` when disabled. Feature is OFF by default; the second AI stream only runs while enabled. Persisted via `mv.incomingEnabled` / `mv.incomingSourceUID` / `mv.incomingOutputUID` and re-applied after `loadSettings()`.
- **Rule:** Any heavy, optional audio engine (ML model load) must be lazily created on enable and torn down to `nil` on disable — never instantiated at launch.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift` (`applyIncomingCleanup`, `persistIncomingSettings`, `loadSettings`).

### [GOTCHA] 2026-06-15 — Incoming SOURCE is input-scope (reject physical mics); MONITOR is output-scope (@Valsaraj)
- **Symptom:** A naïve device list either offers the user's physical mic as an "incoming source" (nonsense) or persists the wrong monitor device.
- **Root cause:** Source and monitor come from DIFFERENT HAL scopes and DIFFERENT maps. Conflating them surfaces physical mics as sources or saves a source UID where a monitor UID belongs.
- **Fix/Rule:** Enumerate sources on the **INPUT** scope (`fetchIncomingDevices`) and filter with `VirtualMicRouting.isSelectableIncomingSource`, which REJECTS physical mics via `DeviceInfo.transportType` (virtual/aggregate) + `hasInput` — only loopback/aggregate inputs qualify. Enumerate monitors on the **OUTPUT** scan (`isSelectableMonitorOutput`) and ALWAYS persist the monitor UID from `monitorOutputUIDByID` (the output map), never from the input-source map.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/VirtualMicRouting.swift`, `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift` (`fetchIncomingDevices`, `fetchOutputDevices`, `persistIncomingSettings`).

### [GOTCHA] 2026-06-15 — Capture a HAL device by UID via AVCaptureDevice(uniqueID:); live buffers are TCC-gated (@Valsaraj)
- **Symptom:** Spike captured nothing from BlackHole at first; easy to misread as "AVCapture can't see virtual devices."
- **Root cause:** `AVCaptureDevice(uniqueID:)` DOES resolve a CoreAudio device's real `kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceUID` and attaches to an `AVCaptureSession` — but live sample-buffer delivery requires microphone (TCC) permission, which a bare spike binary lacks.
- **Fix/Rule:** Resolve the incoming source by its real HAL UID (not name) through `AVCaptureDevice(uniqueID:)`; match the Task-S spike. If buffers don't arrive, suspect TCC/mic permission of the host process FIRST — the resolution + attach path is proven sound.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/IncomingCleanupEngine.swift` (`configureCapture`).

### [DECISION] 2026-06-15 — Carbon RegisterEventHotKey over NSEvent global monitors (@Valsaraj)
- **Problem:** System-wide hotkeys for a backgrounded menu-bar app.
- **Decision:** Use Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` + `InstallEventHandler`. It works under the
  hardened runtime with the existing two entitlements (no new entitlement, no Accessibility prompt).
  `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents` is the SwiftUI-friendly alternative but requires Accessibility
  permission — violating the minimal-entitlement policy.
- **Rule:** Never add Accessibility permission for hotkey capture in this app. If global key
  monitoring is ever needed beyond registered combos, revisit and document the permission impact.
- **Files:** `Sources/App/HotkeyManager.swift`, `Resources/NoNoiseMac.entitlements`

### [PATTERN] 2026-06-15 — Pure reducer in Core makes the control layer testable (@Valsaraj)
- **Problem:** The test target depends on `Core` only; `AudioModel.init()` starts CoreAudio so it
  is not headless-testable. Putting control logic in `Sources/App` (consumed via `@testable import
  Core`) would be untestable and would not even compile from tests.
- **Decision:** Keep the PURE models + a `ControlReducer` over a value-type `ControlState` in
  `Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`. `ActionDispatcher` (App) is a thin adapter (read state from
  `AudioModel` → reduce → write back). Tests exercise the reducer directly — no test-only branches.
- **Rule:** Any control/state logic that must be tested goes in `Core` as a pure function over a
  value type; the App layer only adapts it onto live objects. Never put testable logic in `App`.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`, `Sources/App/ActionDispatcher.swift`,
  `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/ControlLayerTests.swift`

### [GOTCHA] 2026-06-15 — A/B bypass needs desired-vs-effective AI state (@Valsaraj)
- **Problem:** Naïvely saving `isAIEnabled` on bypass entry and restoring on exit breaks if the user
  toggles AI WHILE bypassed: the toggle flips the forced-off live value, then bypass exit clobbers it
  back to the pre-bypass value — the toggle is lost.
- **Root Cause:** A single `isAIEnabled` field conflated "what the user wants" with "what's playing".
- **Fix:** Separate `desiredAI` (what the user wants, flipped by `.toggleAI` always) from effective AI
  (`desiredAI && !bypassed`, written to `AudioModel.isAIEnabled`). Bypass exit recomputes effective
  from the CURRENT desired value. See `ControlReducer` + the bypass-sequence tests.
- **Rule:** When a transient override (bypass) suppresses a user-settable flag, store the user's
  desired value separately and recompute the effective value — don't save/restore the live value.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`, `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/ControlLayerTests.swift`

### [GOTCHA] 2026-06-15 — Carbon EventHotKeyID must be deterministic, not hashValue (@Valsaraj)
- **Problem:** Building `EventHotKeyID.id` from `action.rawValue.hashValue` makes the fired hotkey
  ID un-matchable: Swift's `String.hashValue` is randomized per process, so the value used at
  registration differs from naive reconstruction and the event can't be routed back to its action.
- **Fix:** Derive the numeric ID from the action's index in `HotkeyActionID.allCases` (+1, never 0).
  Also: the Carbon C callback must not call a `@MainActor` method synchronously — extract the
  `EventHotKeyID` in the callback, then hop via `Task { @MainActor in … }`.
- **Rule:** Carbon `EventHotKeyID`s must be stable, deterministic small integers; bridge C callbacks
  to the main actor explicitly instead of assuming the calling thread.
- **Files:** `Sources/App/HotkeyManager.swift`

### [GOTCHA] 2026-06-15 — Dispatcher must apply explicit mutations, never blanket-write AudioModel (@Valsaraj)
- **Problem:** An `ActionDispatcher` that pushed the whole reduced state back onto `AudioModel` every
  dispatch (`model.outputGainValue = state.gain`, `model.selectedPreset = state.preset`, …) corrupted
  preset state. `AudioModel.outputGainValue.didSet` calls `onKnobChanged()`, which flips a non-`.custom`
  preset to `.custom` — so even `.toggleAI` (which never touches gain) demoted Meeting/Podcast/Tutorial
  to Custom. Worse, `.presetNext` wrote `selectedPreset` (whose `didSet` → `applyPreset` sets the
  preset's gain/atten) and THEN wrote the pre-change `state.gain` back, overriding the preset gain and
  re-flipping to Custom.
- **Root Cause:** `AudioModel`'s `@Published` knobs are NOT inert setters — their `didSet`s mutate
  preset state. Writing an unchanged field is not a no-op.
- **Fix:** `ControlReducer.reduce` returns `(ControlState, [ControlMutation])`. Each mutation
  (`.setAIEffective`/`.setPreset`/`.setClarity`/`.setGain`) names exactly one changed field; the adapter
  applies ONLY those. `.toggleAI`/bypass → `.setAIEffective` only; `.presetNext/prev` → `.setPreset`
  only (no trailing gain write — the preset owns its gain); `.gainUp/down` → `.setGain` (the
  `onKnobChanged()` → `.custom` flip is the intended manual-edit behavior).
- **Rule:** When adapting a pure reducer onto a stateful object whose setters have side effects, emit
  an explicit list of changed fields and write only those — never blanket-write the full snapshot.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`, `Sources/App/ActionDispatcher.swift`,
  `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/ControlLayerTests.swift`

### [GOTCHA] 2026-06-15 — Bypass-safe AI must gate the UI toggle, not just the dispatcher (@Valsaraj)
- **Problem:** The desired-vs-effective AI rule is only canonical for dispatcher actions. The popover
  master toggle bound directly to `$audioModel.isAIEnabled`, so during bypass a user could flip the UI
  toggle and write `isAIEnabled = true` straight onto the model — re-enabling AI processing while
  `isBypassed == true`, defeating the bypass.
- **Fix:** Bind the toggle to `dispatcher.aiToggleBinding` (routes through `.toggleAI`) and
  `.disabled(dispatcher.isBypassed)`. Desired AI is still changeable by hotkey while bypassed.
- **Rule:** Any UI control that writes a field also owned by a transient-override state machine must go
  through that machine (or be disabled while the override is active) — a direct binding is a back door.
- **Files:** `Sources/App/ContentView.swift`, `Sources/App/ActionDispatcher.swift`

### [DECISION] 2026-06-15 — Input Volume is app-level pre-DSP trim, not hardware volume (@Valsaraj)
- **Problem:** Hot mics clip or sound crushed/harsh after NoNoise processing; users expect a macOS-like "Input Volume" control.
- **Decision:** Ship **Input Volume** as an app-level scalar applied after conversion and before the ring buffer (`mv.inputVolume`). Do not write macOS system/hardware input volume — keeps behavior reversible, per-app, and consistent across USB/BT/built-in mics. Pair with optional **Smart Level** that only *reduces* gain when trimmed peaks repeatedly hit ~0.98; never auto-boosts. The visible input meter shows trimmed NoNoise input RMS, while raw peak remains a source-clipping warning.
- **Rule:** Audio capture/render paths read a plain `realtimeInputVolume` scalar mirrored from UI state; publish peaks via lock-free scalars + main timer, never `@Published` from realtime threads.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift`, `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/SmartLevelController.swift`, `Sources/App/SettingsView.swift`.

### [DECISION] 2026-06-15 — Broadcast Voice preserves voice identity by construction
- **Problem:** A "crispiness"/clarity control naïvely implemented as a high-shelf boost amplifies
  sibilance, mouth noise, and residual hiss (the classic "ice-pick" voice).
- **Decision:** Implement clarity as (1) a wide-Q **peaking bell** at ~4.5 kHz with **unity gain at
  DC/Nyquist** (cannot alter the vocal fundamental/body) and (2) a **subtractive split-band
  de-esser** `out = x − frac·sib` that is a **perfect identity below threshold** and only removes a
  capped fraction of the sibilant band. De-ess scales WITH the presence lift so "crisp" is always
  paired with sibilance control.
- **Rule:** Any future "voice enhancement" must default to a verifiable null/identity at rest and
  must not color the low/mid band — prove it with a unity-DC-gain test and a below-threshold
  identity test.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/Biquad.swift`,
  `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/Dynamics.swift`, `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/VoiceChain.swift`.

### [PATTERN] 2026-06-15 — Device lists refresh from HAL notifications, not polling or relaunch
- **Symptom:** macOS showed a newly plugged microphone immediately, but NoNoise Mac's input picker
  stayed stale until the app was relaunched.
- **Root cause:** `AudioModel.fetchInputDevices` and `fetchOutputDevices` ran on launch only. There
  was no listener for `kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices`, so the SwiftUI picker never received a new
  published device list after hot-plug events.
- **Fix/Rule:** observe `kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices` on the system object with
  `AudioObjectAddPropertyListenerBlock`, debounce the refresh on the main queue, and refresh both
  AVCapture inputs and CoreAudio outputs. Preserve the selected input if it is still connected; only
  fall back to the system default or first device when the selected mic disappears. Re-resolve the
  NoNoise Mic lifecycle on the same refresh so installing/removing the virtual driver while the app
  is open updates routing and on-demand capture.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift` (`installHardwareDeviceListener`,
  `refreshDevicesAfterHardwareChange`, `fetchInputDevices`).

### [GOTCHA] 2026-06-15 — Swift 5.10 CI cannot type-check `MLShapedArray<Float16>` on macOS
- **Symptom:** GitHub Actions failed in `swift build` on macos-14 / Swift 5.10 with
  `conformance of 'Float16' to 'MLShapedArrayScalar' is unavailable in macOS`, while local Swift 6.3
  builds were green.
- **Root cause:** the generated CoreML wrapper exposed unused `MLShapedArray<Float16>` convenience
  initializers/properties. Even with `@available(macOS 15.0, *)`, Swift 5.10 still type-checks the
  signature and rejects the unavailable Float16 conformance.
- **Fix/Rule:** keep runtime DSP on the `MLMultiArray` path and gate the shaped-array conveniences
  behind `#if compiler(>=6.0)` in `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/DeepFilterNet3_Streaming.swift`.
  If the wrapper is regenerated, preserve that gate or delete those conveniences.

### [GOTCHA] 2026-06-15 — A hidden device is NOT in `kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices`; route to it by UID translate
- **Symptom (first on-device test):** "NoNoise Mic" appeared in recorders but produced **silence**. The
  app was rendering cleaned audio to **BlackHole** instead of the NoNoise engine.
- **Root cause:** the engine device sets `kAudioDevicePropertyIsHidden = 1` (so it stays out of every
  app's picker). But hidden ALSO removes it from the `kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices` enumeration —
  proven by a probe: `engine UID -> id 120, enumerated=false`, while UID-translate still resolves it.
  `AudioModel.fetchOutputDevices` only iterated the enumeration, never saw the engine, and
  `preferredOutputUID` fell back to BlackHole. With the round-1 silence guard, the un-fed mic ring
  correctly returned silence — so the routing miss surfaced as "no audio" rather than garbage.
- **Fix/Rule:** resolve the hidden engine with `kAudioHardwarePropertyTranslateUIDToDevice` (same call
  already used for `driverInstalled`) and INJECT it into the route set; never rely on enumeration to
  find a hidden device. The engine still never enters the user-facing picker.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift` (`fetchOutputDevices`). Probe lives at `/tmp/probe.swift`.

### [DECISION] 2026-06-15 — On-demand capture: hold the real mic only while "NoNoise Mic" is in use
- **Why:** users (rightly) expect the macOS orange mic indicator to be ON only when something is
  actually listening — Krisp behaves this way. Capturing the real mic continuously from app launch
  pins the indicator the whole time the app is open.
- **How:** when the driver is installed, observe `kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsRunningSomewhere` on the
  visible "NoNoise Mic" via `AudioObjectAddPropertyListenerBlock`. Start the `AVCaptureSession` only
  when it flips to running; stop it when it flips off. The render engine to the hidden sink stays
  warm (low-latency start; outputs silence while idle). Keyed to the MIC device (id 118), which the
  app never does IO on, so the signal reflects external consumers only — not our own engine IO (120).
- **Fallback:** without the driver (BlackHole), there's no per-use signal (the app's own output IO
  would make BlackHole's running-state circular), so capture stays always-on.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift` (`resolveVirtualMicLifecycle`, `refreshVirtualMicUsage`,
  `startCapture`/`stopCapture`, gated `setupCaptureSession`).

### [GOTCHA] 2026-06-15 — Loopback ring replays stale speech unless reads are window-guarded (privacy)
- **Symptom (caught in Codex code review):** a modulo ring (`nn_ring_read_at` reading `storage[pos & mask]`)
  keeps returning the LAST ~1.3 s of cleaned audio after the writer stops — because the mic-read device
  and the engine-write device are SEPARATE objects with separate `StartIO`/`StopIO`. App quits / toggles
  off → engine stops writing, but Slack still captures "NoNoise Mic" → it hears a loop of your last words.
- **Root cause:** modulo indexing has no notion of "this frame was never written" — old slot contents alias
  back. Two-device topology makes the writer-stops-while-reader-runs case routine, not exotic.
- **Fix/Rule:** the ring tracks a `writeEnd` watermark (publish release after the slot writes, read acquire
  before). `nn_ring_read_at` zeroes any frame `>= writeEnd` (unwritten) or `< writeEnd - capacity`
  (overwritten). Reads outside the valid window are SILENCE. Host tests assert read-before-write,
  writer-stopped, and partial-straddle silence. Same rule for the `sourceMode==1` mic branch (A2 stub):
  `memset` silence, never serve whatever's lying around.
- **Files:** `Driver/NoNoiseMic/nn_ring.{c,h}`, `Driver/tests/test_nn_ring.c`, `Driver/NoNoiseMic/NoNoiseMic.c`.

### [GOTCHA] 2026-06-15 — HAL driver must size-check every `GetPropertyData` write & validate the FULL ASBD
- **Symptom (Codex review):** scalar/CFString property branches wrote `*(UInt32*)outData = …` /
  `*(CFStringRef*)outData = …` with no `inDataSize` check, and the stream format setter accepted a format
  on rate/id/channels/bits alone — ignoring `mFormatFlags`/`mBytesPerFrame`.
- **Root cause:** a short caller buffer corrupts `coreaudiod`'s heap; a partial ASBD check lets a client
  negotiate a NON-interleaved/repacked layout that `DoIOOperation` (packed-interleaved-only) then
  silently corrupts or channel-swaps. Apple's NullAudio guards every branch for exactly this reason.
- **Fix/Rule:** `PUT_SCALAR`/`PUT_CFSTRING` macros return `kAudioHardwareBadPropertySizeError` before any
  write; the format setter compares the FULL canonical `MakeASBD()` (flags + bytes/frame + bytes/packet +
  frames/packet too) and rejects anything else with `kAudioHardwareIllegalOperationError`.
- **Files:** `Driver/NoNoiseMic/NoNoiseMic.c` (`NoNoiseMic_GetPropertyData`, `NoNoiseMic_SetPropertyData`).

### [DECISION] 2026-06-15 — NoNoise Mic driver: two-device loopback topology, one canonical layout
- **Topology:** a VISIBLE input-only device + a HIDDEN output-only "engine" device (NOT one duplex
  device). The app renders cleaned audio to the engine; consumer apps pick the visible mic. Both
  share ONE `nn_ring` + a per-device `nn_clock` anchored to a SINGLE host time captured on the first
  `StartIO`, so the engine write axis and the mic read axis coincide.
- **One canonical layout everywhere:** 48 kHz, 2ch, **interleaved** Float32 (`kAudioFormatFlagIsFloat
  | kAudioFormatFlagIsPacked`). The HAL's `ioMainBuffer` is passed straight into `nn_ring`
  (`channels=2`) — no de/interleave at any layer. `test_stereo_channels_preserved` guards L/R order
  across a wrap.
- **Phasing:** A1 = in-driver loopback (`sourceMode 0`, default, shipped); A2 = XPC + shared memory
  (`sourceMode 1`) gated behind a coreaudiod-reachability spike. Cross-ref the silent-non-load
  GOTCHA below.
- **Why two devices, not duplex:** keeps the visible mic free of any output stream (clean picker
  semantics) and the engine hidden + non-default-eligible. Full contract in `AGENTS.md` → driver section.

### [GOTCHA] 2026-06-15 — AudioServerPlugIn silently fails to load (signature / CFPlugIn keys)
- **Symptom:** `NoNoiseMic.driver` installed to `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL` but "NoNoise Mic"
  never appears as a device — and `coreaudiod` logs nothing obvious.
- **Root cause:** `coreaudiod` **silently ignores** a HAL plug-in whose code signature is invalid
  or whose `Info.plist` `CFPlugInFactories` / `CFPlugInTypes` keys are wrong (the type UUID must be
  `443ABAB8-E7B3-491A-B985-BEB9187030DB` and the factory string must match the exported
  `NoNoiseMic_Create` symbol). Editing the bundle **after** `codesign` also invalidates the
  signature → silent non-load.
- **Fix/Rule:** `build-driver.sh` signs **after** full assembly; `install-driver.sh` verifies via
  `system_profiler SPAudioDataType | grep "NoNoise Mic"` and the app re-confirms by translating the
  visible UID (`kAudioHardwarePropertyTranslateUIDToDevice`). Never edit a signed `.driver`; rebuild.
- **Files:** `Driver/NoNoiseMic/NoNoiseMic.c`, `Driver/NoNoiseMic/Info.plist`, `build-driver.sh`,
  `install-driver.sh`.

### [GOTCHA] 2026-06-15 — `allow-jit` entitlement is required for CoreML/Metal
- `Resources/NoNoiseMac.entitlements` carries two keys: `com.apple.security.device.audio-input`
  (mic) and `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit`. The latter is needed because DeepFilterNet3 runs on
  GPU/ANE and Metal shader compilation JITs under the hardened runtime — removing it can break
  inference at runtime. It was inherited from the original app (kept byte-identical); justification
  now lives in `AGENTS.md` → Entitlements & signing. Do not strip it without on-device verification.

### [DECISION] 2026-06-15 — Docs must match the real CLI contract
- `NoNoiseMacCLI` with no `--in`/`--out` prints an error and exits 1; `--help` exits 0; device names
  are echoed only after a valid launch (`Sources/CLI/main.swift:21-23,30-34,42,51`). README must
  describe this exactly — a marketing page that advertises a non-existent mode erodes first-release
  trust. Caught by the pre-publish Codex code review.

### [DECISION] 2026-06-15 — AI noise cancellation defaults ON
- `AudioModel.isAIEnabled` defaults to `true` so suppression is active on first launch
  (product decision for NoNoise Mac). The Meeting preset remains the default profile.
- Implication: the model is exercised immediately; keep the CoreML init path healthy.

### [DECISION] 2026-06-15 — Rebrand to NoNoise Mac; internal `mv.*` keys kept
- Renamed display/identifier/bundle to NoNoise Mac / `NoNoiseMac` / `com.ivalsaraj.NoNoiseMac`.
- `UserDefaults` keys intentionally **kept** in the legacy `mv.*` namespace — invisible to
  users, renaming would only add migration risk. See `AGENTS.md` → Branding conventions.

### [GOTCHA] CoreML Float16 outputs read back as zeros on ANE/GPU
- See `critical-patterns.md`. Read model outputs via `NSNumber`, not raw Float16 buffers.

### [GOTCHA] Inventing a spectral compression exponent muffles speech
- Stock DeepFilterNet has none; do not add `c=0.5/0.6` or de-normalize the output.

### [PATTERN] Keep DSP math in pure, testable statics
- `minGain(forAttenuationDb:)`, `resolveOutputBin(...)`, and the `VoiceChain` value types
  (`Biquad`/`Compressor`/`Limiter`) are unit-tested without CoreML. New DSP math should
  follow the same shape (30 tests currently cover this).

### [DECISION] 2026-06-15 — Mouth-noise finishers: subtractive detection preserves voice character
- **Problem**: P-pops and mouth clicks cannot be removed by EQ or de-essing alone — they
  span the wrong frequency bands and timescales.
- **Decision**: (1) `DePlosive` uses a dual-threshold detector (total energy AND low/total
  ratio) to distinguish plosive thumps from voiced stops (B, D, G). Only when BOTH gates
  fire does it subtractively duck the low band (`out = x − frac·lowSig`) — leaving the
  mid-range voice body untouched. (2) `DeClick` uses a fast/slow envelope ratio — a click
  appears as an anomalous spike relative to the speech background — and applies a hold-and-
  release gain only for a few milliseconds, too brief to affect any voiced phoneme.
- **Rule**: Any transient-targeted artifact suppressor must have a dual-gate (absolute
  threshold + relative detection) and be tested for identity below threshold AND
  preservation of the nearest voiced phoneme (voiced stop at the same level as the
  artifact). Single-threshold detection is prone to false positives on consonant bursts.
