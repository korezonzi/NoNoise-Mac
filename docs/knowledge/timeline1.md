# Timeline

Chronological log of notable changes. Newest on top.

### 2026-06-22 — Repin NoNoise Mic Engine after hardware churn (Codex)
- **What:** Added a tested `VirtualMicRouting.shouldRepinPlaybackAfterHardwareRefresh` predicate and
  wired `AudioModel.fetchOutputDevices()` to explicitly rebuild the playback graph when a hardware
  refresh re-resolves the hidden `NoNoise Mic Engine` to the same `AudioObjectID`. Previously that
  unchanged ID bypassed `selectedOutputDeviceID.didSet`, so `setupPlaybackEngine()` did not rerun.
- **Why:** After Bluetooth/headset connect-disconnect churn, the NoNoise meter could still move while
  recorder apps saw silence from `NoNoise Mic`. Killing both NoNoise Mac and `coreaudiod` restored
  output, pointing at stale CoreAudio route state between DSP output and the virtual mic driver.
- **Safety:** The fix is limited to the hidden engine route; unchanged BlackHole fallback routes do
  not force a rebuild. Route-pin failures now surface a recoverable error instead of silently running
  an unpinned graph. Manual Bluetooth churn remains the on-device validation gate.
- **Tests:** `swift test --filter VirtualMicRoutingTests`; full `swift test` before commit.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/VirtualMicRouting.swift`, `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift`,
  `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/VirtualMicRoutingTests.swift`.

### 2026-06-17 — Tutorial preset tuned: Broadcast Voice low + Voice Polish off (@Valsaraj)
- **What:** Tutorial preset now also applies `clarityLevel = .low` (Broadcast Voice) and
  `voicePolishEnabled = false` (Voice Polish) when selected. Added `defaultClarityLevel: ClarityLevel?`
  and `defaultVoicePolish: Bool?` to `VoicePreset`; `applyPreset` applies them when non-nil.
- **Why:** User-validated: Broadcast Voice Low adds gentle presence without over-processing;
  Voice Polish off avoids unnecessary chain overhead for screen-recording use.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/VoicePreset.swift`, `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift`

### 2026-06-16 — Tutorial preset tuned: reduction limit 70 dB + input volume 70% (@Valsaraj)
- **What:** Tutorial preset `attenuationLimitDb` changed from `maxAttenuationDb` (100, unlimited) to
  `70.0` dB. Added `VoicePreset.defaultInputVolume: Float?` — returns `0.70` for `.tutorial`, `nil`
  for all other presets. `applyPreset` now applies `defaultInputVolume` when non-nil, going through
  `SmartLevelController.clampInputVolume` for bounds safety.
- **Why:** User-validated settings for screen-recording / tutorial use: 70 dB reduction limit prevents
  over-suppression of ambient detail; 70% input volume avoids clip-to-DSP before noise reduction.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/VoicePreset.swift`, `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift`

### 2026-06-16 — Clean Incoming rewritten to a Core Audio process tap (no BlackHole) (Valsaraj)
- **What:** replaced the `AVCaptureSession`-of-a-loopback-device "Clean Incoming / Guest" path with a
  Core Audio **process tap** (`CATapDescription(stereoGlobalTapButExcludeProcesses:)` + private
  aggregate + `AudioDeviceIOProcID`) that captures **all system audio except NoNoise**, cleans it
  (DFN only), and re-renders to the **current default output** (auto-following device changes; tapped
  originals muted). **One toggle** — the "Incoming from" / "Hear on" pickers are gone, and no BlackHole
  or manual routing is required. macOS **14.4+** (the whole engine is `@available`-gated so the
  `.macOS(.v13)` package still builds).
- **Realtime safety (the crux):** the tap IOProc (producer) and the `AVAudioSourceNode` render
  (consumer) are BOTH realtime threads. Bridged them with a NEW lock-free C11-atomics SPSC float ring
  (`Sources/CTapRing/tap_ring.{c,h}` + `TapAudioRing` wrapper) modeled on the driver's tested
  `nn_ring` acquire/release discipline — NOT the `os_unfair_lock`-based `RingBuffer` (a lock between
  two realtime threads risks priority inversion/dropouts). Both callbacks are allocation/lock/syscall-
  free and treat the HAL input buffers as read-only (IOProc does a `vDSP` N→mono downmix into a
  pre-allocated scratch, then writes the ring).
- **Truthful lifecycle:** `start() -> Bool` hard-fails if our own audio process object can't be
  resolved (a global-exclude tap around an unknown id would re-capture/mute our own playback). Start
  order: tap → aggregate(48 kHz, `tapautostart`) → read tap ASBD once → IOProc → **playback first** →
  `AudioDeviceStart` last (mute only engages once the cleaned re-render is live). `stop()` is a single
  idempotent teardown run on EVERY failure path — a leaked *muted* tap would mute other apps system-
  wide. `AudioModel` keeps it as a lazy `AnyObject?` (zero cost when off) and binds the UI to a new
  never-lying `incomingCleanupStatus` (`unavailable`/`off`/`cleaning`/`failed`).
- **Removed:** `incomingSourceUID`/`incomingOutputDeviceID` + `mv.incomingSource*`/`mv.incomingOutput*`
  persistence, `fetchIncomingDevices`, the monitor-list branch in `fetchOutputDevices`, the
  `monitorOutput*`/`incomingSource*` maps, `VirtualMicRouting.isSelectableIncomingSource`/
  `isSelectableMonitorOutput`, `DeviceInfo.hasInput`/`transportType`, and the whole
  `IncomingCleanupTests`. Kept `mv.incomingEnabled`.
- **Permissions:** added `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription` to `Info.plist` (a usage string, NOT a new
  entitlement — the two-entitlement policy holds).
- **Tests:** new `TapAudioRingTests` (wrap/fill/drain/underflow/overflow/drop/clear) +
  `IncomingTapLogicTests` (own-process validity, re-pin-vs-rebuild). `swift test` 223 green; debug +
  `-c release --arch arm64` both build.
- **Plan + review:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-16-tap-based-clean-incoming-design.md` (Codex plan
  review APPROVED, 4 rounds). Tap/aggregate/IOProc path + TCC prompt are the manual on-device gate.
- **Files:** `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/{IncomingCleanupEngine,TapAudioRing,IncomingTapLogic,
  VirtualMicRouting}.swift`, `Sources/CTapRing/*`, `Sources/Core/{AudioModel,SettingsResetPolicy}.swift`,
  `Sources/App/{ContentView,SettingsView}.swift`, `Package.swift`, `Resources/Info.plist`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `CONCEPTS.md`.

### 2026-06-16 — Versioned-only releases; fixed v1.3.0 description; pruned rolling builds (Valsaraj)
- **Decision:** pushes to `main` no longer publish a release. Removed the `workflow_run` trigger from
  `release.yml` (+ the dead job `if:`). Rolling `main-<sha>` "stable" releases kept stealing GitHub's
  **Latest** badge from versioned releases and cluttered the Releases page. Releases now come only
  from `v*` tags (`release.sh`) or a manual `stable-latest` dispatch.
- **Bug (release notes):** v1.3.0 first published with the DEFAULT footer, not its tag notes — a
  `workflow_dispatch` retry left the tag peeled, so `git for-each-ref %(contents:body)` read the
  (empty) commit body and fell back. Fixed by force-fetching the annotated tag object before reading
  it; repaired v1.3.0's description in place via `gh release edit`.
- **Cleanup:** deleted 12 rolling `main-<sha>` releases+tags; pinned **v1.3.0** as Latest. Kept
  `main-773470624139` (1.2.0 / build 2, Sparkle-embedded) ONLY for the in-app updater test.
- **Files:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`.

### 2026-06-16 — Released v1.3.0; fixed the versioned-release CI pipeline (Valsaraj)
- Cut **v1.3.0** (build 1003000) — first release carrying the Sparkle auto-updater AND the one-click
  `.pkg`. Notes: auto-updates + one-click installer.
- **CI bug 1 (tag clobber):** the 2nd versioned release failed at "Resolve release target" —
  `git fetch --tags` won't re-fetch a tag CI already holds without `--force`. Fixed with `--force`
  (also yields the annotated tag → correct release notes).
- **CI bug 2 (appcast 403):** the appcast generated + signed fine but couldn't publish — the token
  (repo default `read`, workflow `contents: write`) can create a release for an existing tag but not
  the new `appcast` tag. Bootstrapped the `appcast` release once with an admin token; CI now only
  `upload --clobber`s. See knowledge1.md.
- **CI bug 3:** made the versioned publish idempotent so `workflow_dispatch` retries don't collide.
- **Updater verified (server-side):** live appcast at the `SUFeedURL` advertises 1.3.0 / build
  1003000, EdDSA-signed, enclosure → a downloadable 7.2 MB v1.3.0 app zip. Client test path: install
  the pre-bump stable build (1.2.0 / build 2, Sparkle-embedded) → Check for Updates → offers 1.3.0.
- **Files**: .github/workflows/release.yml

### 2026-06-16 — One-click `.pkg` installer (app + driver) + README demo video (Valsaraj)
- **Why:** release-download users had no way to install the virtual-mic driver — the README told
  them to run `sudo ./install-driver.sh`, a script that ships only in the cloned repo, not in the
  release assets. And `git`/Swift aren't preinstalled on macOS, so build-from-source can't be the
  path for non-technical users.
- **`build-pkg.sh` (new):** stages the already-built `NoNoiseMac.app` → `/Applications` and
  `NoNoiseMic.driver` → `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL` into a `pkgbuild` root (`ditto` to preserve
  the Sparkle.framework symlinks), adds a `postinstall` that `killall coreaudiod` (loads the driver
  without reboot), then `productbuild` wraps it (single-flow UI, arm64-only, macOS 13+ guard) →
  `NoNoiseMac-<ver>.pkg`. `--ownership recommended` gives the HAL plug-in root:wheel on install; the
  driver's ad-hoc signature is copied verbatim (no re-sign → coreaudiod still loads it).
- **Unsigned for now, notarization-ready:** output is unsigned unless `PKG_SIGN_IDENTITY`
  (a "Developer ID Installer" identity) is set, then `productsign` runs — so adding a Developer ID +
  notarization later is config, not rework. User chose unsigned ($0, one "Open Anyway" click).
- **CI:** `release.yml` builds the `.pkg` in "Prepare release assets" for both stable
  (`NoNoiseMac.pkg`) and versioned (`NoNoiseMac-<tag>.pkg`) releases; it lands in `SHA256SUMS`.
- **README:** Install section now leads with the `.pkg` (no Xcode/Terminal), keeps build-from-source
  for contributors, and notes `.pkg` users skip the driver-install commands. Added a `## 🎥 Demo`
  section embedding a GitHub user-attachments video above "What is NoNoise Mac?".
- **Verified locally:** `./build-pkg.sh` → `pkgutil --expand-full` confirmed payload installs to
  Applications + HAL only, postinstall restarts coreaudiod, driver signature intact in the payload.
- **Files:** `build-pkg.sh`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `.gitignore` (`*.pkg`), `README.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`.

### 2026-06-15 — Sparkle auto-updater (Valsaraj)
- Added in-app auto-update via Sparkle 2 (SwiftPM): `UpdaterController` at launch, guarded
  background check in `AppDelegate`, **Check for Updates…** in the popover footer.
- `scripts/version-from-tag.sh` + tests: monotonic `CFBundleVersion` =
  `MAJOR*1000000+MINOR*1000+PATCH` (replaces broken MAJOR.MINOR-digits formula that ignored PATCH).
- `release.sh` stamps via the helper; CI (`release.yml`) asserts plist↔tag↔appcast↔asset and
  publishes EdDSA-signed `appcast.xml` to the fixed `appcast` GitHub release for stable `vX.Y.Z` tags.
- `bundle.sh` embeds `Sparkle.framework` with ditto + inside-out ad-hoc signing (nested `-o runtime`,
  outer app no Hardened Runtime — never `--deep`).
- `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` GitHub secret + `SUPublicEDKey`/`SUFeedURL` in Info.plist.
- `swift build -c release --arch arm64` + `./bundle.sh` + `codesign --verify --deep --strict` green.
- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/knowledge/knowledge1.md`.

### 2026-06-15 — Mouth-noise finishers redesigned: transient de-plosive + peak-follower de-click (Valsaraj)
- **Symptom (user report):** turning Mouth Noise on muffled the highs and added faint distortion.
- **Root cause:** the old `DePlosive` was a STEADY-STATE detector — it ducked the low band whenever
  `lowEnv/totalEnv ≥ 0.60` and `totalEnv > −42 dB`, which holds for ~all voiced speech (vowels are
  low-dominant). It attenuated voiced low-mids continuously and re-injected a phase-shifted
  high-passed copy (`out = (1−frac)·x + frac·hp(x)`), causing intermodulation dullness. The old
  `DeClick` (attack/release fast envelope, ratio 6) was effectively inert on real few-sample clicks.
- **Fix (`Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/Dynamics.swift`):**
  - `DePlosive` → TRANSIENT detector: clean low-pass band (new `Biquad.setLowPass`) gated by BOTH a
    surge (`fastLow/slowLow ≥ 2.5`) AND a concentration test (`fastLow/(fastLow+fastHigh) ≥ 0.78`)
    above a −50 dB floor; reduction amount smoothed (2 ms attack / 40 ms release). Validated: 0%
    fire on sustained vowels, vowel onsets and 60 Hz hum; 2–4 dB knockdown on 40–60 Hz P-pops.
  - `DeClick` → instant-attack PEAK follower vs slow background (10 ms attack), `clickRatio 3.0`,
    with a WALL-CLOCK event latch (`maxClickMs 2.0`, 12 ms gap bridge) so a sustained loud passage
    latches off within ~2 ms while isolated clicks are fully ducked (−12 dB). Smooth 5 ms release
    (no zipper). Preserved: identity-at-rest arming, 75 ms instantaneous-silence disarm, carry-state.
- **Wiring:** `MouthNoiseProfile` constants + both `VoiceChain.configure` call sites updated to the
  new signatures; `MouthNoiseLevel` reduction/floor ladders unchanged.
- **Tests:** `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/MouthNoiseTests.swift` rewritten with realistic signals
  (harmonic vowels, vowel onsets, damped P-pops, high-crest voicing, loud level jumps). `swift test`
  224 green; `swift build` + `swift build -c release --arch arm64` clean.
- `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/Biquad.swift`, `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/Dynamics.swift`,
  `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/VoiceChain.swift`, `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/MouthNoiseTests.swift`,
  `CONCEPTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/knowledge/knowledge1.md`, `docs/knowledge/critical-patterns.md`.

### 2026-06-15 — Input Volume default lowered to 80%
- Changed fresh installs and Settings reset to use `SmartLevelController.defaultInputVolume = 0.8`
  instead of 1.0, so hot mics get a little headroom by default while existing saved `mv.inputVolume`
  values remain untouched.
- `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/SmartLevelController.swift`, `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift`,
  `Sources/App/SettingsView.swift`, `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/SmartLevelControllerTests.swift`,
  `AGENTS.md`.

### 2026-06-15 — Offline audio file denoise CLI (Valsaraj)
- Added `NoNoiseMacCLI --denoise <input> --output <out>` for on-device file cleanup: AVFoundation
  decode → mono 48 kHz → `DeepFilterNetDSP` (with readiness wait) → preset `VoiceChain` → atomic
  temp write. Audio containers only; MP4/video remux explicitly deferred.
- New Core types: `CLIArguments`, `AudioDenoiseOptions`, `AudioFileDenoiser`. Live device and
  `--action` modes unchanged.
- `Sources/Core/CLIArguments.swift`, `Sources/Core/AudioFileDenoiser.swift`,
  `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/DeepFilterNetDSP.swift`, `Sources/CLI/main.swift`,
  `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/CLIArgumentsTests.swift`, `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/AudioFileDenoiserTests.swift`,
  `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/DeepFilterNetDSPTests.swift`, `README.md`, `CONCEPTS.md`, `AGENTS.md`.

### 2026-06-15 — Menu-bar perf: meter observation made idempotent per source (Codex review)
- Codex code review (gpt-5.5, IMPORTANT) flagged that `begin/endMeterObservation` used a blind
  counter, so a duplicate popover `onAppear` or a missed `onDisappear` drifted `meterObserverCount`
  permanently and could leave the gated UI-publish timer running with no visible meter surface.
- Fix: track active surfaces in a `Set<MeterObserver>` (`.popover` / `.settings`) and run the timer
  iff the set is non-empty. Duplicate begins are no-ops (Set insert) and the state self-heals on the
  next clean begin/end cycle. Call sites pass their source. `swift test` (203) + `swift build` pass.
- `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift`, `Sources/App/ContentView.swift`, `Sources/Core/MeterModel.swift`.

### 2026-06-15 — Menu-bar perf: split 25 Hz telemetry into a control pump + gated UI publish
- Fixed sluggish menu-bar popover open + laggy AI toggle. **Root cause:** a 25 Hz `@Published`
  telemetry storm on `AudioModel` — the single meter timer wrote ~11 `@Published` fields every
  40 ms, and because the `MenuBarExtra` label AND the whole `ContentView` observe `AudioModel`,
  every tick re-evaluated the Scene (re-rendering the status-bar `NSImage` via `lockFocus`, even
  while the popover was CLOSED) and re-diffed the entire popover — starving the main thread so the
  open/toggle felt delayed. The toggle handler itself was already cheap.
- **Fix A (zero-risk image caching):** `NoNoiseLogoImage.menuBar(isActive:)` returns a single cached
  template `NSImage` (the draw ignored `isActive`) instead of a fresh `lockFocus` render per call;
  `NoNoiseLogoAsset` caches the header PNG once instead of reading it from disk inside a SwiftUI body.
- **Fix B + C (telemetry isolation, load-bearing):** moved the high-frequency meter fields off
  `AudioModel` onto a new `MeterModel` (`Sources/Core/MeterModel.swift`). Split the single meter
  `Timer` into (1) an ALWAYS-ON ~25 Hz **control pump** (`startControlPump`/`runControlPump`) — the
  sole owner of the `t*` read-and-reset; runs Smart Level + loudness normalization; writes a plain
  `MeterSnapshot` (no `@Published` → zero SwiftUI churn); and (2) a **popover-gated** UI-publish timer
  (`beginMeterObservation`/`endMeterObservation`, reference-counted across popover + Settings) that
  copies the snapshot into `MeterModel`. Scoped the meter reads into `StatusMeters`/`LiveHUDCard`
  (popover) and `GeneralSettingsView` (Settings) so only those subviews observe the 25 Hz stream.
- Cadence parity preserved (25 Hz) so the loudness slew (`slewDb:1`/tick) + Smart Level tick
  thresholds keep their tuned timing; both control loops stay live with the popover closed. Seeded on
  `begin` so meters aren't stale on reopen. `swift test` (203), `swift build`, release arm64 all pass.
- `Sources/Core/MeterModel.swift` (new), `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift`,
  `Sources/App/NoNoiseLogoMark.swift`, `Sources/App/ContentView.swift`, `Sources/App/SettingsView.swift`.

### 2026-06-15 — Settings reset added
- Added a destructive-confirmed **Reset Settings** card in Settings → General. It restores
  audio/device settings to defaults (Meeting preset, full suppression, 80% input volume, unity output gain,
  Voice Polish on, Broadcast Voice/Mouth Noise/Smart Level/Loudness/Incoming cleanup off, LUFS
  target −14) while preserving saved Voice Profiles and custom Hotkeys.
- Added `SettingsResetPolicy` as the single resettable-key list, with a headless XCTest proving
  reset removes app/audio keys but preserves `mv.profiles` and `mv.hotkey.*`.
- `Sources/App/SettingsView.swift`, `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift`,
  `Sources/Core/SettingsResetPolicy.swift`, `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/SettingsResetPolicyTests.swift`.

### 2026-06-15 — Fix: loudness peak-safe copy now states the real limiter ceiling
- Code review (Codex, MINOR) flagged that the Settings loudness caption and `CONCEPTS.md`
  claimed normalization is capped "~3 dB below clipping", but the actual `VoiceChain`
  limiter ceiling is −1 dBFS (−0.5 in Tutorial). Corrected the user-facing copy to "just
  below clipping (≈ −1 dBFS)" so the peak-safety claim is accurate.
- `Sources/App/SettingsView.swift`, `CONCEPTS.md`.

### 2026-06-15 — Fix: integrated-LUFS rolling window desynced after the block ring wrapped
- Code review (Codex) caught that `LoudnessMeter.integratedLUFS` divided **lifetime** sums
  (`absGatedCount` / `absGatedMSSum`, incremented forever) to set the relative-gate
  threshold, while the gated loop only summed the last `maxBlocks` entries actually in the
  fixed ring. After the 1 h ring wrapped the two windows desynced, so a long-gone loud
  passage could pin the headline LUFS ~20 LU too high.
- Fix: keep `absGatedMSSum` in lock-step with the ring (subtract the evicted block before
  overwriting a full slot), drop the lifetime `absGatedCount`, and divide by
  `blockMSRingFilled` (the relative loop already reads only those entries). Added a
  regression test that forces a wrap via a small `internal init(sampleRate:integrationBlocks:)`.
- `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/LoudnessMeter.swift`, `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/LoudnessMeterTests.swift`.

### 2026-06-15 — Metering & Loudness added
- Added an ITU-R BS.1770 `LoudnessMeter` (REAL K-weighting via the published 48 kHz
  coefficients — a new `Biquad.setCoefficients` direct-coefficient path — → momentary +
  gated-integrated LUFS, sample-peak; validated at 1 kHz / 60 Hz / 6 kHz). Integrated
  LUFS uses a fixed-size pre-allocated block ring (no `append` on the render path). The
  meter is mutated only on the render thread and snapshotted into plain scalars
  (`tMomentaryLUFS` / `tIntegratedLUFS`); it is never read cross-thread.
- Added a derived **AI-activity** signal (`DeepFilterNetDSP.aiActivity` = energy-weighted
  per-bin `1 − wetMag/dryMag` from the blend, one-pole smoothed) — a UX hint, 0 when AI off.
- Added optional **loudness normalization**: a slew-limited make-up gain toward −14/−16
  LUFS applied pre-limiter in `VoiceChain` (new `loudnessActive` activation reason so it
  works in Meeting mode; persisted `mv.loudnessNorm` / `mv.loudnessTarget`, OFF by default).
- **Reused the Smart Level telemetry layer** (the existing ~25 Hz `meterTimer` /
  `publishMeterTelemetry` and `recordOutputTelemetry`, `tOutputPeak` / `isOutputClipping`)
  rather than adding a parallel path — extended them with output RMS level + LUFS snapshots
  and the normalization-gain computation. v1 ships sample-peak (not oversampled true-peak)
  per the perf mandate. UI: Live HUD in the popover (input/output meters, CLIP, AI bar,
  momentary LUFS, latency); loudness panel in Settings (integrated LUFS + normalize toggle
  + −14/−16 target).

### 2026-06-15 — Clean Incoming / Guest — code-review hardening (Codex 4-round, APPROVED)
- HAL capability detection now SUMS `AudioBufferList.mBuffers[*].mNumberChannels` instead of using
  `AudioObjectGetPropertyDataSize > 0` — the latter reports phantom channels (non-zero header for a
  zero-channel scope) and could misclassify an input-only mic as a monitor output.
- Feedback guard: `applyIncomingCleanup()` refuses to run without a chosen REAL monitor
  (`incomingOutputDeviceID != 0` + both predicates re-validated); the "Hear on" picker gained an
  explicit "Select…" state. It never falls back to the system default output (which would feed back
  through the captured loopback).
- Lifecycle is now truthful + strictly zero-cost-when-off: `IncomingCleanupEngine.start()` returns
  `Bool` (true ONLY when capture attach + monitor pin + `engine.start()` all succeed; capture is
  started only after playback is live), `AudioModel` retains the engine ONLY on a true start, and
  `refreshDevicesAfterHardwareChange()` re-validates/tears-down on device add/remove. `stop()` also
  cleans up the attached-but-idle state so playback-failure teardown is deterministic.
- Verified via `swift build` + 89 unit tests green; live-audio paths remain manual smoke.

### 2026-06-15 — Mouth-Noise Finishers (de-plosive + de-click) added
- Added two new identity-at-rest `VoiceChain` stages after the de-esser: `DePlosive` (subtractive
  low-band plosive gate, `out = x - frac * lowSig`) and `DeClick` (broadband transient gate,
  `out = x * gain`). Both are pure value types in `Dynamics.swift`, gated by `MouthNoiseLevel`
  (off/low/medium/high) carried on `VoiceChainSettings` and injected by
  `AudioModel.applyVoiceChain()`. Persisted under `mv.mouthNoise`.
- UI: segmented picker in Settings and the popover. Design invariant — identity at rest — enforced
  structurally and proven by XCTest.

### 2026-06-15 — Hot-mic ceiling fix (trimmed input meter, no Tutorial boost, full Smart Level floor)
- **Input meter now reflects the trimmed signal.** `AudioModel.captureOutput` measured RMS on the
  pre-trim source, so lowering Input Volume left the meter pinned at max. Added
  `SmartLevelController.applyInputVolumeAndMeasure` (one allocation-free helper: raw scan →
  in-place trim → trimmed peak/RMS/hot) and `evaluateInputGuard` (pure mirror of the input-side
  meter + Smart Level contract).
- **Tutorial preset no longer hides a boost.** `outputGain` 1.2 → 1.0 and `compMakeupDb` 4 → 0.
- **Smart Level auto floor 35% → 25%.** `minAutoInputVolume = minInputVolume`, so protective
  auto-trim can reach the same floor as the manual Input Volume control. Still never auto-boosts.

### 2026-06-15 — Clean Incoming / Guest (Phase 1) shipped
- Added `IncomingCleanupEngine` — a SECOND, independent capture→clean→play pipeline that
  de-noises the audio the user *hears* (a noisy guest/caller). Captures a loopback/aggregate
  **INPUT** (BlackHole/Loopback) via `AVCaptureDevice(uniqueID:)`, runs its OWN `DeepFilterNetDSP`
  (DFN only, no Voice polish), and re-plays the cleaned audio to the chosen monitor output.
- `AudioModel` owns it as an OPTIONAL, created on the enabled transition and torn down to `nil`
  when off (off by default; the second AI stream only runs while enabled). New persisted keys
  `mv.incomingEnabled` / `mv.incomingSourceUID` / `mv.incomingOutputUID`.
- Source list enumerated on the INPUT scope (`fetchIncomingDevices`) with
  `VirtualMicRouting.isSelectableIncomingSource` (rejects physical mics via transport type +
  `hasInput`); monitor list comes from the OUTPUT scan (`isSelectableMonitorOutput`).
- UI: a **Clean Incoming / Guest** card in Settings (enable + *Incoming from* / *Hear on* pickers
  + no-loopback warning), a compact toggle in the popover, and two new Setup Guide steps for the
  loopback routing.
- **Spike (Task S):** proved HAL enumeration surfaces BlackHole (UID + virtual transport) and that
  `AVCaptureDevice(uniqueID:)` resolves that UID and attaches to an `AVCaptureSession`. Live
  sample-buffer delivery is gated only by on-device TCC (mic permission), not by the design — so
  the AVCapture-by-UID path is sound. 14 device-classification unit tests added.

### 2026-06-15 — Control layer (global hotkeys + A/B bypass + Stream Deck) added
- Added the pure control models + `ControlReducer` to `Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`
  (`ControlAction`, `HotkeyActionID`, `HotkeyBinding`, `HotkeyModifier`, `ControlState`,
  `ControlMutation`) so the real dispatch logic is unit-tested headlessly without `AudioModel`.
- The reducer returns `(ControlState, [ControlMutation])`; `ActionDispatcher` (Sources/App) applies
  ONLY the emitted mutations onto a live `AudioModel` — never a blanket field write-back, which would
  re-trip the knob `didSet`s (writing `outputGainValue` flips a preset to `.custom`; writing
  `selectedPreset` re-applies the preset's own gain). So `.toggleAI` no longer demotes the active
  preset to Custom and `.presetNext` keeps the preset-defined gain.
- `HotkeyManager` (Sources/App) registers system-wide Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` combos (default
  ⌃⌥ set, deterministic `EventHotKeyID`s) with UserDefaults persistence under `mv.hotkey.*`; created
  at app launch in `NoNoiseMacApp.init()` so hotkeys are live before the popover opens (and
  `appDelegate.dispatcher` is wired in `init()` too, so the URL fallback works pre-popover).
- `nonoisemac://` URL scheme registered in `Resources/Info.plist`.
- A/B bypass uses a desired-vs-effective AI model: while bypassed, AI is forced off and toggle-AI
  updates the DESIRED state (restored on bypass exit) — never persisted; the popover master toggle
  routes through the dispatcher and is disabled during bypass so AI can't be re-enabled against an
  active bypass.
- Gain nudge clamps to the slider's `0.5...4.0`. `NoNoiseMacCLI` extended with `--action <verb>`.
- Post-review hardening (Codex): the CLI's `--action` verbs now resolve through the canonical
  `ControlAction.from(cliVerb:)` + new `ControlAction.urlString` (single source of truth,
  round-trip tested) instead of a private verb→URL dictionary that the tests couldn't reach;
  `HotkeyManager.register` logs non-`eventHotKeyExistsErr` failures (no silent failure) while
  still surfacing them as conflicts; removed an unused `@State` in the Hotkeys settings view.
### 2026-06-15 — GitHub report action added
- Added a compact **Report** action to the menu-bar popover footer and a matching
  **Report a feature or issue** link in Settings. Both open the NoNoise Mac GitHub issue template
  chooser through a shared app support URL constant.
- Arranged the popover device rows horizontally, with each label beside its picker/status and the
  Output route on the next row.

### 2026-06-15 — Input Volume & Smart Level shipped
- Added app-level **Input Volume** (25%…100%, originally default 100%, `mv.inputVolume`) applied pre-ring-buffer
  in `AudioModel.captureOutput`, plus optional **Smart Level** (`mv.smartLevel`) that gradually lowers
  Input Volume or Output Gain when sample peaks repeatedly approach the ceiling.
- Cheap scalar peak/clip telemetry on capture/render threads; ~25 Hz main timer publishes warnings
  (`Input too loud`, `Output clipping`, source-mic clipping) and runs Smart Level via the pure
  `SmartLevelController` helper. UI in Settings and popover status card.

### 2026-06-15 — Voice Profiles: save/recall/rename/delete named setting snapshots

Added a **Voice Profiles** system: `VoiceProfile` (versioned `Codable` struct, extensible via
optional fields), `VoiceProfileStore` (pure CRUD + JSON serialization, headless XCTest-able),
and three new `AudioModel` methods (`saveCurrentAsProfile`, `applyProfile`, `deleteProfile`,
`renameProfile`). Profiles are persisted as a JSON array under `mv.profiles`. The `applyProfile`
path goes through `isApplyingPreset = true … = false` to prevent spurious `.custom` flips or
redundant `applyVoiceChain` / `persistSettings` calls mid-apply. UI: a Profiles card in
`GeneralSettingsView` with Save Current / Recall / Rename / Delete per row. Schema is forward-
compatible: Mouth Noise, Input Volume, and Smart Level are optional profile fields, and future
Metering & Loudness fields can be added without migration.

### 2026-06-15 — Input Volume & Smart Level plan
- Added `docs/plans/2026-06-15-input-volume-smart-level.md`, a focused plan for hot-mic protection:
  a macOS-worded **Input Volume** control applied pre-DSP, cheap input/output sample-peak detection,
  and an optional **Smart Level** mode that gradually reduces Input Volume or Output Gain when the
  voice repeatedly approaches the ceiling.

### 2026-06-15 — Broadcast Voice (clarity) added
- Added an Off/Low/Medium/High **Broadcast Voice** control: a wide-Q presence peaking bell
  (`Biquad.setPeaking`) + a subtractive split-band `DeEsser` (`Dynamics.swift`), wired into
  `VoiceChain` via `ClarityLevel` on `VoiceChainSettings` and injected by
  `AudioModel.applyVoiceChain()` on top of the active preset (persisted under `mv.clarity`).
- UI: a segmented picker in Settings and in the menu-bar popover.
- Design constraint — preserve the original voice — enforced structurally: the de-esser is an
  identity below threshold, the presence bell has unity gain at DC **and Nyquist** (both proven by
  test in `BroadcastVoiceTests`), and `clarity == .off` leaves existing presets byte-for-byte unchanged.

### 2026-06-15 — Live input-device refresh
- Added a CoreAudio hardware-device listener in `AudioModel` so newly plugged microphones refresh
  into the NoNoise Mac input picker without relaunching the app. Refreshes are debounced, preserve
  the selected mic when it is still connected, and re-resolve the NoNoise Mic lifecycle when the
  virtual driver appears or disappears.

### 2026-06-15 — Single brand logo in popover
- Kept the NoNoise PNG as the popover header logo, and changed the Noise Cancellation status-card
  badge back to a semantic SF Symbol so the widget does not show duplicate brand marks.

### 2026-06-15 — Stable release after successful main CI
- Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` so a successful `CI` workflow on `main` automatically
  rebuilt, bundled, and uploaded the latest `NoNoiseMac.app`, `NoNoiseMacCLI`, `NoNoiseMic.driver`,
  and checksums to a stable GitHub Release. Versioned `v*` tag releases remained supported.

### 2026-06-15 — Stop moving the `stable` Git tag
- Removed the release workflow's `git tag -f stable` / force-push path. Stable main builds now use
  immutable `main-<short-sha>` tags and are marked as GitHub's **Latest** release, so developer
  machines no longer hit `git pull --tags` conflicts from a moving local `stable` tag.

### 2026-06-15 — Apple Silicon performance mandate
- Added an `AGENTS.md` rule requiring all future implementation work to optimize for M-series Macs:
  low CPU, low memory churn, low latency, no avoidable battery drain, and no hot-path allocations or
  polling without a measured reason. The rule explicitly preserves correctness, privacy, and audio
  quality as non-negotiable while requiring measured, maintainable performance work.

### 2026-06-15 — NoNoise logo in menu bar and popover
- Replaced the SF Symbol waveform used in the menu-bar item and popover status card with a shared
  NoNoise mark, so the visible app identity matches the NoNoise logo. The menu-bar variant uses a
  plain template `NSImage` for reliable `MenuBarExtra` rendering; the popover/settings variants use
  the bundled `NoNoiseMacLogo.png`.

### 2026-06-15 — CI Swift 5.10 compatibility + tag-gated release workflow
- Gated unused `MLShapedArray<Float16>` convenience APIs in the generated CoreML wrapper behind
  `#if compiler(>=6.0)` so GitHub Actions' macos-14 / Swift 5.10 runner can compile the project.
  Runtime DSP still uses the `MLMultiArray` path required by the CoreML output-readback rule.
- Added `.github/workflows/release.yml`: only `v*` tags whose commit is contained in `origin/main`
  publish zipped `NoNoiseMac.app`, `NoNoiseMacCLI`, `NoNoiseMic.driver`, and checksums.

### 2026-06-15 — Apple Silicon install script
- Added `install-app.sh`, a one-command local installer that runs `swift build -c release --arch arm64`,
  bundles/signs `NoNoiseMac.app`, installs it to `/Applications`, verifies the copied app signature,
  and optionally stages `NoNoiseMic.driver` via `--with-driver`.
- Documented the release-build rule in `AGENTS.md`: local installs MUST use the optimized arm64
  release path because NoNoise Mac is Apple-Silicon-only.

### 2026-06-15 — Tier 3 / Spec A Phase A1: NoNoise Mic virtual microphone driver
- Shipped a userspace CoreAudio **AudioServerPlugIn** (`Driver/NoNoiseMic/`) publishing a visible
  input-only **NoNoise Mic** + a hidden output-only **NoNoise Mic Engine** (48 kHz, 2ch,
  interleaved Float32). Apps select "NoNoise Mic" directly — no BlackHole, no default juggling.
- **Transport:** Phase A1 in-driver **loopback** (`sourceMode = 0`); A2 (XPC + shared memory,
  `sourceMode = 1`) is gated behind a coreaudiod-reachability spike (plan Task 12).
- **Risky math is CoreAudio-free + host-tested:** `nn_ring` (sample-time wraparound, interleaved
  L/R) and `nn_clock` (O(1) monotonic zero-timestamp) → `Driver/tests/run-tests.sh`, also wired
  into CI alongside a driver compile+sign check.
- **App wiring:** `AudioModel.fetchOutputDevices` auto-routes the engine output by **real UID**
  (`VirtualMicRouting.preferredOutputUID`: engine → BlackHole → else unset), detects install via
  `kAudioHardwarePropertyTranslateUIDToDevice`, and filters hidden/virtual devices from its
  pickers; `ContentView` shows a "NoNoise Mic ready / not installed" row; Settings guide + README
  rewritten to the new routing model (BlackHole demoted to fallback).
- **Contract/decisions** live in `AGENTS.md` → "NoNoise Mic virtual driver"; the silent-non-load
  trap is in `knowledge1.md`. Original MIT implementation — not Apple sample source, not derived
  from BlackHole (GPL-3.0).
- **Plan + review:** `docs/plans/2026-06-15-nonoise-mic-virtual-driver-plan.md` (Codex plan review
  APPROVED, 3 rounds). On-device install/verify (sudo + coreaudiod restart) is the user's manual gate.

### 2026-06-15 — NoNoise Mac v1.0.0 (initial public release)
- Rebranded the project from **MetalVoice** (by Ghostkwebb,
  https://github.com/Ghostkwebb/MetalVoice, MIT) to **NoNoise Mac**: identifiers, bundle id
  `com.ivalsaraj.NoNoiseMac`, assets, CLI (`NoNoiseMacCLI`), and all UI strings.
- Made the repo **AI-native**: this knowledge base, `CONCEPTS.md`, the agent catalog
  (`docs/agents/README.md`), an expanded `AGENTS.md` (overview + ICP + architecture +
  branding conventions), and CI.
- **UI overhaul**: polished menu-bar popover (hero status card, live meter, sectioned
  cards) and Settings (branded header, consistent cards).
- **AI noise cancellation ON by default.**
- DSP/model/audio behavior unchanged. `swift build` + 30 tests green; `swift build -c release`
  + `./bundle.sh` produce a signed `NoNoiseMac.app` + `NoNoiseMacCLI`.
- **Pre-publish Codex code review** (gpt-5.5, 2 rounds → APPROVED): fixed the README CLI section
  to match real `NoNoiseMacCLI` behavior (documented `--help`; removed a non-existent no-arg
  "list devices" mode), and documented the two signing entitlements in `AGENTS.md`.

### Pre-rebrand (inherited from MetalVoice history)
- Voice Polish chain (Biquad/Compressor/Limiter + per-preset profiles + master toggle).
- Preset modes (Meeting/Podcast/Tutorial/Custom) + suppression-strength & reduction-limit knobs.
- DSP correctness fixes: read CoreML outputs via `NSNumber`; match DeepFilterNet feature
  pipeline (no invented compression); stride-aware spectrum reads.
