# Timeline

Chronological log of notable changes. Newest on top.

### 2026-06-15 — Metering & Loudness added
- Added an ITU-R BS.1770 `LoudnessMeter` (REAL K-weighting via the published 48 kHz
  coefficients — a new `Biquad.setCoefficients` direct-coefficient path — → momentary +
  gated-integrated LUFS, sample-peak; validated at 1 kHz / 60 Hz / 6 kHz). Integrated
  LUFS uses a fixed-size pre-allocated block ring (no `append` on the render path). The
  meter is mutated only on the render thread and snapshotted into plain scalars
  (`tMomentaryLUFS` / `tIntegratedLUFS`); it is never read cross-thread.
- Added a derived **AI-activity** signal (`DeepFilterNetDSP.aiActivity` = energy-weighted
  per-bin `1 − wetMag/dryMag` from the blend, one-pole smoothed) — a UX hint, 0 when AI off.
- Added optional **loudness normalization**: a slew-limited make-up gain toward −14/−16
  LUFS applied pre-limiter in `VoiceChain` (new `loudnessActive` activation reason so it
  works in Meeting mode; persisted `mv.loudnessNorm` / `mv.loudnessTarget`, OFF by default).
- **Reused the Smart Level telemetry layer** (the existing ~25 Hz `meterTimer` /
  `publishMeterTelemetry` and `recordOutputTelemetry`, `tOutputPeak` / `isOutputClipping`)
  rather than adding a parallel path — extended them with output RMS level + LUFS snapshots
  and the normalization-gain computation. v1 ships sample-peak (not oversampled true-peak)
  per the perf mandate. UI: Live HUD in the popover (input/output meters, CLIP, AI bar,
  momentary LUFS, latency); loudness panel in Settings (integrated LUFS + normalize toggle
  + −14/−16 target).

### 2026-06-15 — GitHub report action added
- Added a compact **Report** action to the menu-bar popover footer and a matching
  **Report a feature or issue** link in Settings. Both open the NoNoise Mac GitHub issue template
  chooser through a shared app support URL constant.
- Arranged the popover device rows horizontally, with each label beside its picker/status and the
  Output route on the next row.

### 2026-06-15 — Input Volume & Smart Level shipped
- Added app-level **Input Volume** (25%…100%, default 100%, `mv.inputVolume`) applied pre-ring-buffer
  in `AudioModel.captureOutput`, plus optional **Smart Level** (`mv.smartLevel`) that gradually lowers
  Input Volume or Output Gain when sample peaks repeatedly approach the ceiling.
- Cheap scalar peak/clip telemetry on capture/render threads; ~25 Hz main timer publishes warnings
  (`Input too loud`, `Output clipping`, source-mic clipping) and runs Smart Level via the pure
  `SmartLevelController` helper. UI in Settings and popover status card.

### 2026-06-15 — Input Volume & Smart Level plan
- Added `docs/plans/2026-06-15-input-volume-smart-level.md`, a focused plan for hot-mic protection:
  a macOS-worded **Input Volume** control applied pre-DSP, cheap input/output sample-peak detection,
  and an optional **Smart Level** mode that gradually reduces Input Volume or Output Gain when the
  voice repeatedly approaches the ceiling.

### 2026-06-15 — Broadcast Voice (clarity) added
- Added an Off/Low/Medium/High **Broadcast Voice** control: a wide-Q presence peaking bell
  (`Biquad.setPeaking`) + a subtractive split-band `DeEsser` (`Dynamics.swift`), wired into
  `VoiceChain` via `ClarityLevel` on `VoiceChainSettings` and injected by
  `AudioModel.applyVoiceChain()` on top of the active preset (persisted under `mv.clarity`).
- UI: a segmented picker in Settings and in the menu-bar popover.
- Design constraint — preserve the original voice — enforced structurally: the de-esser is an
  identity below threshold, the presence bell has unity gain at DC **and Nyquist** (both proven by
  test in `BroadcastVoiceTests`), and `clarity == .off` leaves existing presets byte-for-byte unchanged.

### 2026-06-15 — Live input-device refresh
- Added a CoreAudio hardware-device listener in `AudioModel` so newly plugged microphones refresh
  into the NoNoise Mac input picker without relaunching the app. Refreshes are debounced, preserve
  the selected mic when it is still connected, and re-resolve the NoNoise Mic lifecycle when the
  virtual driver appears or disappears.

### 2026-06-15 — Single brand logo in popover
- Kept the NoNoise PNG as the popover header logo, and changed the Noise Cancellation status-card
  badge back to a semantic SF Symbol so the widget does not show duplicate brand marks.

### 2026-06-15 — Stable release after successful main CI
- Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` so a successful `CI` workflow on `main` automatically
  rebuilds, bundles, and uploads the latest `NoNoiseMac.app`, `NoNoiseMacCLI`, `NoNoiseMic.driver`,
  and checksums to the `stable` GitHub Release. Versioned `v*` tag releases remain supported.

### 2026-06-15 — Apple Silicon performance mandate
- Added an `AGENTS.md` rule requiring all future implementation work to optimize for M-series Macs:
  low CPU, low memory churn, low latency, no avoidable battery drain, and no hot-path allocations or
  polling without a measured reason. The rule explicitly preserves correctness, privacy, and audio
  quality as non-negotiable while requiring measured, maintainable performance work.

### 2026-06-15 — NoNoise logo in menu bar and popover
- Replaced the SF Symbol waveform used in the menu-bar item and popover status card with a shared
  NoNoise mark, so the visible app identity matches the NoNoise logo. The menu-bar variant uses a
  plain template `NSImage` for reliable `MenuBarExtra` rendering; the popover/settings variants use
  the bundled `NoNoiseMacLogo.png`.

### 2026-06-15 — CI Swift 5.10 compatibility + tag-gated release workflow
- Gated unused `MLShapedArray<Float16>` convenience APIs in the generated CoreML wrapper behind
  `#if compiler(>=6.0)` so GitHub Actions' macos-14 / Swift 5.10 runner can compile the project.
  Runtime DSP still uses the `MLMultiArray` path required by the CoreML output-readback rule.
- Added `.github/workflows/release.yml`: only `v*` tags whose commit is contained in `origin/main`
  publish zipped `NoNoiseMac.app`, `NoNoiseMacCLI`, `NoNoiseMic.driver`, and checksums.

### 2026-06-15 — Apple Silicon install script
- Added `install-app.sh`, a one-command local installer that runs `swift build -c release --arch arm64`,
  bundles/signs `NoNoiseMac.app`, installs it to `/Applications`, verifies the copied app signature,
  and optionally stages `NoNoiseMic.driver` via `--with-driver`.
- Documented the release-build rule in `AGENTS.md`: local installs MUST use the optimized arm64
  release path because NoNoise Mac is Apple-Silicon-only.

### 2026-06-15 — Tier 3 / Spec A Phase A1: NoNoise Mic virtual microphone driver
- Shipped a userspace CoreAudio **AudioServerPlugIn** (`Driver/NoNoiseMic/`) publishing a visible
  input-only **NoNoise Mic** + a hidden output-only **NoNoise Mic Engine** (48 kHz, 2ch,
  interleaved Float32). Apps select "NoNoise Mic" directly — no BlackHole, no default juggling.
- **Transport:** Phase A1 in-driver **loopback** (`sourceMode = 0`); A2 (XPC + shared memory,
  `sourceMode = 1`) is gated behind a coreaudiod-reachability spike (plan Task 12).
- **Risky math is CoreAudio-free + host-tested:** `nn_ring` (sample-time wraparound, interleaved
  L/R) and `nn_clock` (O(1) monotonic zero-timestamp) → `Driver/tests/run-tests.sh`, also wired
  into CI alongside a driver compile+sign check.
- **App wiring:** `AudioModel.fetchOutputDevices` auto-routes the engine output by **real UID**
  (`VirtualMicRouting.preferredOutputUID`: engine → BlackHole → else unset), detects install via
  `kAudioHardwarePropertyTranslateUIDToDevice`, and filters hidden/virtual devices from its
  pickers; `ContentView` shows a "NoNoise Mic ready / not installed" row; Settings guide + README
  rewritten to the new routing model (BlackHole demoted to fallback).
- **Contract/decisions** live in `AGENTS.md` → "NoNoise Mic virtual driver"; the silent-non-load
  trap is in `knowledge1.md`. Original MIT implementation — not Apple sample source, not derived
  from BlackHole (GPL-3.0).
- **Plan + review:** `docs/plans/2026-06-15-nonoise-mic-virtual-driver-plan.md` (Codex plan review
  APPROVED, 3 rounds). On-device install/verify (sudo + coreaudiod restart) is the user's manual gate.

### 2026-06-15 — NoNoise Mac v1.0.0 (initial public release)
- Rebranded the project from **MetalVoice** (by Ghostkwebb,
  https://github.com/Ghostkwebb/MetalVoice, MIT) to **NoNoise Mac**: identifiers, bundle id
  `com.ivalsaraj.NoNoiseMac`, assets, CLI (`NoNoiseMacCLI`), and all UI strings.
- Made the repo **AI-native**: this knowledge base, `CONCEPTS.md`, the agent catalog
  (`docs/agents/README.md`), an expanded `AGENTS.md` (overview + ICP + architecture +
  branding conventions), and CI.
- **UI overhaul**: polished menu-bar popover (hero status card, live meter, sectioned
  cards) and Settings (branded header, consistent cards).
- **AI noise cancellation ON by default.**
- DSP/model/audio behavior unchanged. `swift build` + 30 tests green; `swift build -c release`
  + `./bundle.sh` produce a signed `NoNoiseMac.app` + `NoNoiseMacCLI`.
- **Pre-publish Codex code review** (gpt-5.5, 2 rounds → APPROVED): fixed the README CLI section
  to match real `NoNoiseMacCLI` behavior (documented `--help`; removed a non-existent no-arg
  "list devices" mode), and documented the two signing entitlements in `AGENTS.md`.

### Pre-rebrand (inherited from MetalVoice history)
- Voice Polish chain (Biquad/Compressor/Limiter + per-preset profiles + master toggle).
- Preset modes (Meeting/Podcast/Tutorial/Custom) + suppression-strength & reduction-limit knobs.
- DSP correctness fixes: read CoreML outputs via `NSNumber`; match DeepFilterNet feature
  pipeline (no invented compression); stride-aware spectrum reads.
