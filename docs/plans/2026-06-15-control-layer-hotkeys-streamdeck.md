**Goal:** Add a **control layer** on top of `AudioModel` that exposes every user-facing action
(toggle AI, A/B bypass, cycle preset, cycle Broadcast Voice level, nudge output gain) as:
1. Typed Swift methods on a new `ActionDispatcher` coordinator.
2. System-wide hotkeys (Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey`), user-configurable and persisted under
   `mv.*`, with a settings UI to view and rebind.
3. A **custom URL scheme** (`nonoisemac://`) registered in `Info.plist` and handled in the app,
   so Stream Deck "Website/Open" (or `open nonoisemac://…`) can fire each action.
4. Extended `NoNoiseMacCLI` with discrete action verbs (`toggle`, `bypass`, `preset-next`, etc.)
   as a secondary scripting path.

**Architecture:** The control layer is split across two targets so it stays unit-testable:

- **`Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`** holds the PURE, framework-free models — the
  `ControlAction` enum (with its `nonoisemac://` URL + CLI parsers and gain constants), the
  `HotkeyActionID` enum, the `HotkeyBinding` model, the `ControlMutation` enum (the explicit
  list of model fields an action changed), and a pure `ControlReducer` seam that describes the
  state transitions WITHOUT touching `AudioModel`. The test target depends only on `Core`
  (`@testable import Core`), so these models MUST live in `Core` to be testable. They import
  nothing beyond `Foundation` — `HotkeyBinding` stores a plain `UInt32` modifier mask, NOT
  `NSEvent.ModifierFlags`.
- **`Sources/App/ActionDispatcher.swift`** holds the `ActionDispatcher` coordinator that adapts
  the pure reducer onto a live `AudioModel`. It sits between `AudioModel` (the Core state machine)
  and all external triggers.
- **`Sources/App/HotkeyManager.swift`** holds the Carbon / AppKit registration layer. This is the
  ONLY place `Carbon`, `AppKit`, and `NSEvent.ModifierFlags` appear; it adapts the pure `UInt32`
  modifier mask at the App boundary.

`AudioModel` itself gains **no knowledge** of hotkeys or URL schemes — all that wiring lives in
App. The Core target stays free of `Carbon` / `AppKit`-specific imports and fully unit-testable.

> **Why not a new SwiftPM target?** The existing `Core` target is already imported by both
> `NoNoiseMac` and the test target, and it is framework-free at the Swift level for these models
> (it links AVFoundation/CoreML, but the new file imports only `Foundation`). Adding the pure
> models to `Core` is the minimal change — no `Package.swift` edit is required. A separate
> `ControlCore` library target was considered and rejected as unnecessary indirection.

**Tech Stack:** Swift 5.9, SwiftUI, Carbon (`RegisterEventHotKey`), AppKit (`NSApp`,
`NSApplicationDelegate`), Swift Package Manager, XCTest.

**GitHub Issue:** #5 — https://github.com/ivalsaraj/NoNoise-Mac/issues/5

**Execution location:** All commands run from the package root — the directory that contains
`Package.swift`. All paths are repo-relative.

## Context

### Why these specific features

`AudioModel` already owns all the hot-path knobs: `isAIEnabled`, `selectedPreset`,
`voicePolishEnabled`, `clarityLevel`, `outputGainValue`, `suppressionStrength`. They are
`@Published` and guarded by `isApplyingPreset`. They are safe to write from the main thread
while the render callback reads them on a background thread (arm64 scalar stores are atomic;
the `isApplyingPreset` flag is the only multi-step guard and is only used from main).

Power users — streamers, podcasters, online educators — need **hardware-backed controls** (a
dedicated hotkey or a physical Stream Deck button) that work while they are focused in another
app. The menu-bar popover requires clicking the menu-bar icon; that is too slow during a live
stream.

### Actions surface (all dispatched through `ActionDispatcher`)

| Action ID | What it does | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `toggleAI` | Flip `isAIEnabled` | Safe to fire from background (see below) |
| `bypass` | Momentary or toggle passthrough | A/B bypass; see design |
| `presetNext` | Cycle `selectedPreset` forward | Wraps around |
| `presetPrev` | Cycle `selectedPreset` backward | Wraps around |
| `clarityNext` | Cycle `clarityLevel` forward | Wraps at `.high` → `.off` |
| `gainUp` | `outputGainValue += 0.1` (clamped to 4.0) | Matches the Settings slider range |
| `gainDown` | `outputGainValue -= 0.1` (clamped to 0.5) | Matches the Settings slider range |

> **Gain bounds:** The Settings → General "Output Gain" slider is `0.5...4.0`
> (`SettingsView.swift` `gainCard`). The hotkey/URL gain nudge MUST clamp to the SAME range —
> `gainMin = 0.5`, `gainMax = 4.0` — so a nudged value never lands outside what the slider can
> represent.

**Safety from a backgrounded global hotkey or URL open:** All these writes go to
`AudioModel`'s `@Published` properties on the main thread. `ActionDispatcher` is `@MainActor`,
so every `dispatch(_:)` runs on the main actor; the Carbon C callback (off the actor) hops via
`Task { @MainActor in … }` before calling the dispatcher, and SwiftUI `onOpenURL` / the
`@MainActor`-isolated `AppDelegate.application(_:open:)` are already on the main thread. The
render callback reads plain `Float`/`Bool` scalars (lock-free on arm64) or checks `isAIEnabled`
inside the audio thread — exactly the existing pattern for `outputGain` etc. No additional
synchronization is needed.

### A/B bypass design — desired vs. effective AI state

The naïve approach (save `isAIEnabled` on bypass entry, restore on exit) has a state hole:
if the user fires **toggle-AI while bypassed**, that toggle must change what AI will be AFTER
bypass — not flip the live `AudioModel.isAIEnabled` (which is forced `false` during bypass) and
then get clobbered on bypass exit.

The fix is a single canonical **desired** AI state separate from the **effective** state pushed
to `AudioModel`:

- `desiredAIEnabled: Bool` — the user's intended AI on/off, ignoring bypass. This is the value
  that `.toggleAI` flips, ALWAYS, whether or not bypass is active.
- **Effective** = `desiredAIEnabled && !effectiveBypass`. This is what gets written to
  `AudioModel.isAIEnabled`.
- `effectiveBypass = isBypassedMomentary || isBypassedToggle`.

`desiredAIEnabled` is seeded from `AudioModel.isAIEnabled` when the dispatcher is created, and is
kept in sync whenever `.toggleAI` fires. While bypassed, `.toggleAI` updates `desiredAIEnabled`
but keeps `AudioModel.isAIEnabled = false`; on bypass exit, the effective state is recomputed and
`desiredAIEnabled` is restored. Bypass state is session-only (never persisted); `desiredAIEnabled`
mirrors the persisted `isAIEnabled` preference, so the persisted value is correct after bypass exit.

Two gestures:
- **Momentary (hold):** Hotkey down → bypass on; hotkey up → bypass off. Carbon supplies
  separate `EventHotKeyPressed` / `EventHotKeyReleased` events. The default bypass key is
  mapped to the momentary path.
- **Toggle:** One additional `bypassToggle` action ID. Both can be hotkey-bound.

`isBypassedMomentary` and `isBypassedToggle` are tracked separately so a momentary hold and a
latched toggle can overlap without one cancelling the other; effective bypass = OR of the two.

### Why the reducer returns an explicit mutation list (NOT a blanket state write-back)

`AudioModel`'s knob `didSet`s are NOT inert setters — they have side effects that make a blanket
"write every field back from `state`" approach corrupt preset state:

- `outputGainValue.didSet` (and `suppressionStrength`/`attenuationLimitDb`) calls
  `onKnobChanged()`, which flips a non-`.custom` preset (Meeting/Podcast/Tutorial) to `.custom`
  and persists. So writing `model.outputGainValue = state.gain` on EVERY dispatch — even for
  `.toggleAI`, which never touches gain — silently demotes the active preset to Custom.
- `selectedPreset.didSet` calls `applyPreset(...)`, which (under the `isApplyingPreset` guard)
  sets `suppressionStrength`, `attenuationLimitDb`, AND `outputGainValue` from the preset's own
  parameters. A blanket adapter that writes `model.selectedPreset = …` and THEN writes
  `model.outputGainValue = state.gain` would overwrite the preset-defined gain with the
  pre-change gain AND re-trip `onKnobChanged()` → flip back to `.custom`. So `presetNext` would
  land on Custom with the wrong gain instead of the intended preset.

**Fix:** the pure `ControlReducer` returns `(ControlState, [ControlMutation])`. Each
`ControlMutation` names EXACTLY one model field the action changed (`.setAIEffective(Bool)`,
`.setPreset(VoicePreset)`, `.setClarity(ClarityLevel)`, `.setGain(Float)`). The App-side adapter
applies ONLY the emitted mutations — never a blanket write of unchanged `gain`/`preset`/`clarity`.

Action → emitted mutations:

| Action | Mutations | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `toggleAI` | `.setAIEffective` | Never touches preset/gain/clarity, so they are NOT written — no `.custom` demotion. |
| `bypassMomentaryDown/Up`, `bypassToggle` | `.setAIEffective` | Bypass only changes effective AI; preset/gain/clarity untouched. |
| `presetNext`/`presetPrev` | `.setPreset` (+ `.setAIEffective` if effective AI changed) | `AudioModel.selectedPreset` OWNS preset-parameter application (gain/atten/suppression via `applyPreset`). The adapter does NOT write `gain` afterward — the preset's gain is preserved and the preset is NOT flipped to `.custom`. |
| `clarityNext` | `.setClarity` | `clarityLevel.didSet` does NOT call `onKnobChanged()`, so it never flips the preset. |
| `gainUp`/`gainDown` | `.setGain` | Writes `outputGainValue`; the existing `onKnobChanged()` flip to `.custom` is the INTENDED knob behavior — a manual gain nudge is a custom edit, exactly like dragging the Settings slider. |

`.setAIEffective` carries the recomputed `effectiveAI`, so the adapter writes
`model.isAIEnabled` only when the effective value actually changed (toggle + bypass actions),
keeping the write off the preset/gain path entirely. `desiredAI` and the bypass flags live ONLY
in the reducer's `ControlState` (the adapter never reads `model.isAIEnabled` back into `desiredAI`
while bypassed — that would corrupt it, since it is forced `false`).

### Global hotkey API choice: Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey`

**Chosen API: Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` / `InstallEventHandler`.**

Rationale:
- Works system-wide from a backgrounded menu-bar app (`LSUIElement`) with **no additional
  entitlements or permissions** — specifically, no `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events`
  and no Accessibility permission prompt.
- `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents(matching:)` is the SwiftUI-friendly alternative but
  **requires Accessibility permission** (the "NoNoise Mac would like to monitor keyboard input"
  prompt). That adds a second permissions friction point, and CLAUDE.md demands entitlements
  remain minimal. It is therefore **not used**.
- Carbon hotkeys are registered per-combo, not per-event-stream, which means only the
  combos we register ever fire our handler — no ambient keyboard snooping, better for privacy.
- The Carbon `EventHotKeyID` + `InstallEventHandler` pattern is well-supported on Apple
  Silicon macOS 13+ and is used by many menu-bar utilities (1Password, Raycast, etc.).

**Entitlement impact:** None. `RegisterEventHotKey` works under the hardened runtime with the
current two entitlements (`audio-input` + `allow-jit`). No new entitlement key is needed.

**Permission prompt:** None. Carbon hotkeys do not trigger an Accessibility prompt.

**Limitation:** If another app has already registered the same combo, `RegisterEventHotKey`
returns `eventHotKeyExistsErr` (-9878). `HotkeyManager` must handle this gracefully — log,
surface a UI warning ("hotkey in use"), and leave that slot unregistered without crashing.

### URL scheme design (Stream Deck path)

Custom URL scheme `nonoisemac://` registered in `Info.plist` (`CFBundleURLTypes`). No new
entitlement is needed for a custom URL scheme — it is a standard `Info.plist` registration.

Verbs map to action IDs:

| URL | Action |
|---|---|
| `nonoisemac://toggle` | `toggleAI` |
| `nonoisemac://bypass` | `bypassToggle` |
| `nonoisemac://preset/next` | `presetNext` |
| `nonoisemac://preset/prev` | `presetPrev` |
| `nonoisemac://clarity/next` | `clarityNext` |
| `nonoisemac://gain/up` | `gainUp` |
| `nonoisemac://gain/down` | `gainDown` |

**Stream Deck setup (documented):** Stream Deck "Open" action → URL → `nonoisemac://toggle`.
No Stream Deck SDK, no Stream Deck plugin, no developer account required. Works with Stream
Deck 6.x+ "Website" action in "Open in browser" mode (macOS opens the URL scheme registered
in `Info.plist`).

**URL-scheme registration in a SwiftPM `.app` bundle:** `Info.plist` is already in
`Resources/`, which `bundle.sh` copies into the `.app` bundle during signing. The
`CFBundleURLTypes` array is added to `Resources/Info.plist`. SwiftPM debug builds do NOT
register URL schemes (no bundle registration in the Swift package runner). URL-scheme handling
is only testable in the bundled `.app` (via `./bundle.sh` or `./install-app.sh`). This is
documented explicitly in Task 6 and the smoke-test section.

**`NSApplicationDelegate.application(_:open:)` vs `open urls:`:** On macOS 13+ with
`MenuBarExtra`-based apps (`@main struct … : App`), URL-scheme delivery goes through the
SwiftUI `App.onOpenURL` modifier, NOT through `NSApplicationDelegate`. Both are handled —
`NoNoiseMacApp` wires `onOpenURL` on the scene, and `AppDelegate` provides a fallback
`application(_:open:)` implementation. The `ActionDispatcher` is passed by reference from
`@StateObject` so both paths route to the same instance.

### `NoNoiseMacCLI` action verbs

`NoNoiseMacCLI` is a headless pipeline that initialises `AudioModel`. It can also emit
one-shot action commands using `--action <verb>` (starts model, fires the action, then
exits). Since `AudioModel.init()` is asynchronous (device setup), the existing 1-second
`RunLoop.main.run(until:…)` settle is reused.

## Current code facts (verified against the repo)

- `Sources/Core/AudioModel.swift`: `isAIEnabled`, `selectedPreset`, `voicePolishEnabled`,
  `clarityLevel` (added by the broadcast-voice plan), `outputGainValue` are `@Published` +
  `didSet`, guarded by `isApplyingPreset`. `PrefKey` enum lives at lines ~114–121. All
  written from main; render thread reads via lock-free arm64 scalars.
- `Sources/App/NoNoiseMacApp.swift`: `@main`, `@StateObject var audioModel = AudioModel()`,
  `@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate`. `AppDelegate` has
  `applicationDidFinishLaunching` only.
- `Sources/App/ContentView.swift`: `modeCard` uses a segmented `Picker` bound to
  `$audioModel.selectedPreset`. Cards use `nnCard()`.
- `Sources/CLI/main.swift`: simple flag parser; sets `model.selectedInputDeviceID`,
  `model.selectedOutputDeviceID`, `model.outputGainValue`, `model.isAIEnabled = true`.
- `Resources/Info.plist`: `LSUIElement = true`, `CFBundleIdentifier = com.ivalsaraj.NoNoiseMac`.
  No `CFBundleURLTypes` yet.
- `Resources/NoNoiseMac.entitlements`: exactly two keys (`audio-input`, `allow-jit`).
- `Package.swift`: `Core` target, `NoNoiseMac` app target, `NoNoiseMacCLI` executable,
  `NoNoiseMacTests` test target. Swift tools version 5.9, macOS 13+. The test target depends on
  **`Core` only** — it does NOT depend on `NoNoiseMac` (the app target). Anything tested must be
  reachable from `@testable import Core`.
- `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/`: headless, no CoreAudio/CoreML. `@testable import Core`.
- `VoicePreset`: `String, CaseIterable, Identifiable, Sendable` in `Sources/Core/VoicePreset.swift`;
  cases can be cycled via `allCases` index arithmetic.
- `ClarityLevel`: `String, CaseIterable, Identifiable, Sendable` in
  `Sources/Core/AudioProcessing/VoiceChain.swift`; same cycling pattern (added by broadcast-voice plan).
- `Sources/App/ContentView.swift`: `ContentView(audioModel:)`; the gear button and the footer
  button both call `WindowManager.openSettings(model:)`. `WindowManager` (an `NSWindow` coordinator)
  and `SettingsView(audioModel:)` both live here / in `SettingsView.swift`.
- `Sources/App/SettingsView.swift`: `SettingsView(audioModel:)` hosts a `TabView` with two tabs
  (`GeneralSettingsView`, `GuideView`). The "Output Gain" slider range is **`0.5...4.0`** — the
  canonical gain range the hotkey nudge must match.

## Task 0: Branch

- [ ] **Step 1: Create a feature branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feat/control-layer-hotkeys-streamdeck
```

Expected: `Switched to a new branch 'feat/control-layer-hotkeys-streamdeck'`. Use
`git add <specific files>` in every commit — never `git add -A` or `.`.

## Task 1: Pure control models + reducer in `Core` — unit-testable core — TDD

Define the typed action enum, the persisted hotkey-binding model, the action-ID enum, and a
**pure state reducer** (`ControlReducer`) that describes every state transition WITHOUT touching
`AudioModel`. All of this is framework-free (imports only `Foundation`) and lives in `Core` so the
test target (`@testable import Core`) can exercise it directly. The Carbon/AppKit `HotkeyManager`
(Task 2) and the live `ActionDispatcher` adapter (Task 3) build on top of these models.

**Files:**
- Create: `Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`
- Create: `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/ControlLayerTests.swift`

> **Why a reducer seam?** `AudioModel.init()` starts CoreAudio/AVFoundation, so it is NOT
> headless-testable (same constraint as the existing preset/DSP tests). To test the REAL dispatch
> logic — bypass transitions, the desired-vs-effective AI rule, hotkey→action mapping, gain
> clamping, preset/clarity cycling, and rebind persistence — without constructing `AudioModel`, the
> mutations are expressed as a pure function over a value-type `ControlState` snapshot. The reducer
> returns BOTH the next `ControlState` AND an explicit `[ControlMutation]` list naming exactly which
> `AudioModel` fields changed, so the App-side adapter applies ONLY those fields (never a blanket
> write-back that would re-trip `AudioModel`'s knob `didSet` side effects — see "Why the reducer
> returns an explicit mutation list" above). The App-side `ActionDispatcher` (Task 3) is a thin
> adapter: read state from `AudioModel` → run the reducer → apply the emitted mutations. No test-only
> branches exist in production code; the reducer is the production code path, exercised directly by
> tests and re-used verbatim by the adapter.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to verify they pass**

```bash

```

Expected: all tests PASS. These models + the reducer are the REAL dispatch logic — the App-side
`ActionDispatcher` (Task 3) re-uses `ControlReducer.reduce` verbatim, so this is not a test-only
shadow implementation.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/ControlLayerTests.swift
git commit -m "feat(control): add pure ControlAction/HotkeyBinding/ControlReducer to Core (testable)"
```

---

## Task 2: `ActionDispatcher` adapter + Carbon `HotkeyManager` — App layer

Build the App-side layer on top of the pure Core models from Task 1: the `ActionDispatcher`
(adapts `ControlReducer` onto a live `AudioModel`) and the Carbon `HotkeyManager` (registers
system-wide hotkeys and routes them through the dispatcher). Both are `@MainActor` and conform to
`ObservableObject` because the UI observes them (`@ObservedObject` / `@StateObject`).

No new XCTest here — the real dispatch logic is already tested via `ControlReducer` in Task 1
(`ActionDispatcher` is a thin adapter that cannot be constructed headlessly because it depends on
`AudioModel`, which starts CoreAudio). Verified by build.

**Files:**
- Create: `Sources/App/ActionDispatcher.swift`
- Create: `Sources/App/HotkeyManager.swift`

### Step 1: Implement the `ActionDispatcher` adapter

/// Adapts the pure `ControlReducer` onto a live `AudioModel`. Owns the session-only A/B
/// bypass state and the canonical `desiredAI` flag. Must be held for the app's lifetime.
///
/// All mutations run on the main thread (`@MainActor`); callers from other threads MUST hop
/// to the main actor first. AudioModel's `@Published` knobs are written from main exactly
/// like the existing UI bindings (the render thread reads lock-free arm64 scalars — see
/// AGENTS.md "Real-time audio rules").
@MainActor
public final class ActionDispatcher: ObservableObject {

### Step 2: Implement the Carbon `HotkeyManager`

/// Registers and manages system-wide Carbon hotkeys. Must be created and retained for the
/// lifetime of the app. All methods run on the main thread (`@MainActor`).
///
/// **Why Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` and not `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents`:**
/// Carbon hotkeys work under the hardened runtime with the existing two entitlements
/// (audio-input + allow-jit) and require NO additional permissions. NSEvent global monitors
/// require Accessibility permission (a user-visible prompt) — deliberately avoided to keep the
/// entitlement surface minimal (see AGENTS.md "Entitlements & signing").

> **Why these fixes vs. the reviewer's findings:**
> - `ActionDispatcher.dispatch` applies ONLY the reducer's `[ControlMutation]` — it NEVER
>   blanket-writes `outputGainValue`/`selectedPreset`/`clarityLevel` every call. This is the
>   fix for the round-3 critical finding: a blanket gain write re-trips `onKnobChanged()` (which
>   flips Meeting/Podcast/Tutorial → `.custom`), and writing gain after a preset change overrides
>   the preset's own gain. `toggleAI` now emits only `.setAIEffective`; `presetNext` emits only
>   `.setPreset` (no trailing gain write), so it lands on the intended preset with the preset's gain.
> - `ObservableObject` conformance is now explicit on BOTH `ActionDispatcher` and
>   `HotkeyManager`, so `@ObservedObject` / `@StateObject` and `@Published` compile.
> - `import AppKit` + `import Combine` + `import Carbon.HIToolbox` are all present; the Core
>   models supply `HotkeyActionID` / `HotkeyBinding` / `HotkeyModifier` / `ControlAction`.
> - The C Carbon callback no longer calls a `@MainActor` method synchronously — it extracts the
>   `EventHotKeyID` (valid only during the callback) and then hops via `Task { @MainActor in … }`.
> - `EventHotKeyID.id` is DETERMINISTIC (`allCases` index + 1), not `rawValue.hashValue` — so the
>   fired ID reliably matches back to its action across process launches.

- [ ] **Step 3: Build**

```bash
swift build
```

Expected: build succeeds. The full test suite is unchanged from Task 1 (no new headless-testable
surface here):

```bash
swift test
```

Expected: all tests PASS (existing suite + Task 1 `ControlLayerTests`).

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add Sources/App/ActionDispatcher.swift Sources/App/HotkeyManager.swift
git commit -m "feat(hotkeys): add ActionDispatcher adapter + Carbon HotkeyManager (ObservableObject, main-actor bridge)"
```

## Task 3: Wire `ActionDispatcher` + `HotkeyManager` into the app lifecycle

`NoNoiseMacApp` creates the dispatcher AND the `HotkeyManager` at **app startup** (in `init()`),
holds both on `@StateObject`, passes references down to `ContentView`, and registers the
URL-scheme handler. `AppDelegate` gets a `application(_:open:)` fallback. No new entitlements.

> **Critical: hotkeys must register at launch, not on first popover open.** A `MenuBarExtra`'s
> content view is only instantiated when the popover is first shown, so `ContentView.onAppear`
> does NOT run at launch. Creating `HotkeyManager` in `onAppear` would leave every system-wide
> hotkey DEAD until the user clicks the menu-bar icon — defeating the entire feature (a streamer
> must be able to hit ⌃⌥B while focused in OBS, having never opened the popover). Both the
> dispatcher and the `HotkeyManager` are therefore created in `NoNoiseMacApp.init()` and retained
> on `@StateObject`, so Carbon registration happens during app launch.

**Files:**
- Modify: `Sources/App/NoNoiseMacApp.swift`
- Modify: `Sources/App/ContentView.swift` (add the `dispatcher` + `hotkeyManager` stored
  properties so the new `ContentView(...)` call site compiles; they are USED in Tasks 5–6).

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the new stored properties to `ContentView`**

In `Sources/App/ContentView.swift`, extend `ContentView`'s property block so the call site
below compiles (the properties are exercised by the bypass banner in Task 6 and the Settings
threading in Task 5):

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @ObservedObject var audioModel: AudioModel
    @ObservedObject var dispatcher: ActionDispatcher
    @ObservedObject var hotkeyManager: HotkeyManager
    // body unchanged in this task
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Update `NoNoiseMacApp.swift`**

Replace the entire file content with:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Core

@main
struct NoNoiseMacApp: App {
    @NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate

    // The Core state machine, the action coordinator, and the Carbon hotkey layer are all
    // created ONCE in init() and retained on @StateObject for the app's lifetime. Creating
    // HotkeyManager here (NOT in ContentView.onAppear) guarantees global hotkeys are live
    // from launch — the MenuBarExtra content view doesn't instantiate until the popover opens.
    @StateObject var audioModel: AudioModel
    @StateObject private var dispatcher: ActionDispatcher
    @StateObject private var hotkeyManager: HotkeyManager

    init() {
        // Init order matters: AudioModel → ActionDispatcher(model:) → HotkeyManager(dispatcher:).
        let model = AudioModel()
        let dispatcher = ActionDispatcher(model: model)
        let hotkeys = HotkeyManager(dispatcher: dispatcher)   // registers Carbon hotkeys NOW
        _audioModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: model)
        _dispatcher = StateObject(wrappedValue: dispatcher)
        _hotkeyManager = StateObject(wrappedValue: hotkeys)

        // Hand the dispatcher to the AppDelegate at LAUNCH (finding #3) — NOT in
        // ContentView.onAppear. A MenuBarExtra's content view isn't instantiated until the
        // popover first opens, so wiring the URL fallback in onAppear leaves AppDelegate's
        // application(_:open:) with a nil dispatcher until then: a bundled .app would drop
        // `open nonoisemac://toggle` fired before the popover was ever opened. The
        // @NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor's wrapped value is constructed before this init body
        // runs, so `appDelegate` is available here.
        appDelegate.dispatcher = dispatcher
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        MenuBarExtra {
            ContentView(audioModel: audioModel, dispatcher: dispatcher, hotkeyManager: hotkeyManager)
        } label: {
            Image(nsImage: NoNoiseLogoImage.menuBar(isActive: audioModel.isAIEnabled))
        }
        .menuBarExtraStyle(.window)
        // SwiftUI delivers URL opens to the scene via onOpenURL on macOS 13+. The AppDelegate
        // fallback (wired at launch above) covers the case where onOpenURL isn't delivered
        // (e.g. the URL arrives before the scene graph is active).
        .onOpenURL { url in
            guard let action = ControlAction.from(url: url) else { return }
            dispatcher.dispatch(action)
        }
    }
}

// @MainActor on the whole delegate: AppKit delivers these callbacks on the main thread, and it
// lets us touch the @MainActor `dispatcher` and call `dispatch(_:)` without a concurrency error.
@MainActor
class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {
    /// Wired by NoNoiseMacApp.init() at LAUNCH (finding #3), so the URL fallback below has a
    /// dispatcher before the popover is ever opened.
    var dispatcher: ActionDispatcher?

    func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
        NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)
    }

    /// Fallback URL handler for cases where the SwiftUI onOpenURL doesn't fire
    /// (e.g. app already backgrounded and not in the active scene graph).
    func application(_ application: NSApplication, open urls: [URL]) {
        for url in urls {
            guard let action = ControlAction.from(url: url) else { continue }
            dispatcher?.dispatch(action)
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note (`@StateObject` cross-reference):** `HotkeyManager` holds a plain stored reference to
> `dispatcher`, which is itself an independent object created first in `init()`. There is no
> init-order cycle — both are fully constructed as local lets before being wrapped in
> `StateObject`. The earlier `@State var hotkeyManager: HotkeyManager?` + `onAppear` lazy-init
> approach is REJECTED precisely because it delays Carbon registration to first popover open.
>
> **Note (`appDelegate.dispatcher` wired in `init()`, finding #3):** the assignment moved OUT of
> `ContentView.onAppear` and INTO `NoNoiseMacApp.init()`. The `@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor`'s
> wrapped value is constructed before the `init()` body executes (it is a stored property the
> wrapper initializes), so `appDelegate` is a live instance here. Wiring at launch means the
> AppDelegate's `application(_:open:)` URL fallback works even if a `nonoisemac://` open arrives
> before the popover (and thus the scene's `onOpenURL`) is ever active. Re-verify with the bundled
> `.app`: `open nonoisemac://toggle` immediately after launch, without opening the popover, must
> toggle AI (smoke-test step 0b).
>
> **Note (`@MainActor` construction + assignment in `App.init()`):** `ActionDispatcher` and
> `HotkeyManager` are `@MainActor`, and `AppDelegate` is `@MainActor` (so `appDelegate.dispatcher =
> dispatcher` touches a main-actor property). SwiftUI calls `@main App.init()` on the main thread,
> and under this package's Swift 5.9 default concurrency checking this compiles cleanly (no
> `-strict-concurrency=complete`). If a future Swift-6 mode flags it, annotate the `init()` (or the
> App type) `@MainActor` — do NOT move construction or the dispatcher hand-off back into `onAppear`,
> which would reintroduce the launch-timing bug (hotkeys dead + URL fallback nil until first click).

- [ ] **Step 3: Build**

```bash
swift build
```

Expected: build succeeds. (At this point `ContentView` has the new stored properties but the body
does not yet read `dispatcher`/`hotkeyManager` — that lands in Tasks 5–6. SwiftUI tolerates unused
stored `@ObservedObject` properties, so the build is green.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add Sources/App/NoNoiseMacApp.swift Sources/App/ContentView.swift
git commit -m "feat(app): create dispatcher + HotkeyManager at launch (hotkeys live before popover opens)"
```

---

## Task 4: Register `nonoisemac://` URL scheme in `Info.plist`

Add the `CFBundleURLTypes` array so macOS routes `nonoisemac://` opens to our app. No new
entitlement is required — custom URL-scheme registration is a pure `Info.plist` declaration.

**Files:**
- Modify: `Resources/Info.plist`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add `CFBundleURLTypes`**

In `Resources/Info.plist`, add the following block immediately before the closing `</dict>`:

```xml
	<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
	<array>
		<dict>
			<key>CFBundleURLName</key>
			<string>com.ivalsaraj.NoNoiseMac</string>
			<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
			<array>
				<string>nonoisemac</string>
			</array>
		</dict>
	</array>
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Build**

```bash
swift build
```

Expected: build succeeds (SwiftPM copies `Info.plist` into the product bundle).

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add Resources/Info.plist
git commit -m "feat(url-scheme): register nonoisemac:// URL scheme in Info.plist"
```

> **Note on testing URL-scheme registration:** `swift build` / `swift run` do NOT register
> URL schemes — the Swift package runner doesn't install a proper `.app` bundle. URL-scheme
> handling must be verified via `./bundle.sh` + opening the resulting `NoNoiseMac.app` (Task 8
> smoke test step 5).

---

## Task 5: Hotkey Settings UI — view + rebind sheet

Add a **Hotkeys** tab to `SettingsView` so users can see current bindings and rebind any action.
A conflict warning is shown for collided slots. Threading the `hotkeyManager` reference into the
Settings window touches THREE files — all signatures and call sites are updated in this ONE task /
commit so the build never lands in a half-threaded state.

**Files:**
- Modify: `Sources/App/SettingsView.swift` — `HotkeySettingsView` + `RebindSheet` + `KeyCaptureView`;
  `SettingsView(audioModel:)` → `SettingsView(audioModel:hotkeyManager:)`.
- Modify: `Sources/App/ContentView.swift` — `ContentView` gains a `hotkeyManager` property;
  `WindowManager.openSettings(model:)` → `WindowManager.openSettings(model:hotkeyManager:)`; both
  `openSettings` call sites (header gear button + footer Settings button) pass `hotkeyManager`.
- (`Sources/App/NoNoiseMacApp.swift` already passes `hotkeyManager:` to `ContentView(...)` from
  Task 3 — no further change here.)

No XCTest (SwiftUI view) — verified by build + manual smoke test.

### Step 1: Add `HotkeySettingsView`

In `Sources/App/SettingsView.swift`, add the following after the existing `GeneralSettingsView`:

```swift
// MARK: - Hotkey Settings

struct HotkeySettingsView: View {
    @ObservedObject var manager: HotkeyManager
    @State private var rebindingAction: HotkeyActionID?
    @State private var isListeningForKey: Bool = false

    private let actionLabels: [(HotkeyActionID, String)] = [
        (.toggleAI,        "Toggle Noise Cancellation"),
        (.bypassMomentary, "A/B Bypass (hold for raw)"),
        (.bypassToggle,    "A/B Bypass (toggle)"),
        (.presetNext,      "Preset → Next"),
        (.presetPrev,      "Preset → Previous"),
        (.clarityNext,     "Broadcast Voice → Next Level"),
        (.gainUp,          "Output Gain +"),
        (.gainDown,        "Output Gain −"),
    ]

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 0) {
            Text("Global Hotkeys")
                .font(.title3).fontWeight(.semibold)
                .padding(.bottom, 12)

            ForEach(actionLabels, id: \.0) { (id, label) in
                hotkeyRow(id: id, label: label)
                Divider()
            }

            if !manager.conflictedActions.isEmpty {
                HStack(spacing: 6) {
                    Image(systemName: "exclamationmark.triangle.fill").foregroundColor(.orange)
                    Text("Some hotkeys conflict with another app. Rebind them or change the conflicting app's shortcuts.")
                        .font(.caption).foregroundColor(.secondary)
                }
                .padding(.top, 10)
            }
        }
        .padding()
        .sheet(item: $rebindingAction) { id in
            RebindSheet(actionID: id, manager: manager)
        }
    }

    private func hotkeyRow(id: HotkeyActionID, label: String) -> some View {
        HStack {
            Text(label).frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
            Spacer()
            if manager.conflictedActions.contains(id) {
                Image(systemName: "exclamationmark.circle.fill").foregroundColor(.orange)
                    .help("This combo is in use by another app")
            }
            if let b = manager.bindings[id] {
                Text(hotkeyDisplayString(b))
                    .font(.system(.body, design: .monospaced))
                    .foregroundColor(.secondary)
            } else {
                Text("—").foregroundColor(.secondary)
            }
            Button("Edit") { rebindingAction = id }
                .controlSize(.small)
        }
        .padding(.vertical, 6)
    }

    private func hotkeyDisplayString(_ b: HotkeyBinding) -> String {
        var s = ""
        // b.modifiers is a plain UInt32 (Core HotkeyModifier bits) — test bits directly.
        let m = b.modifiers
        if m & HotkeyModifier.control.rawValue != 0 { s += "⌃" }
        if m & HotkeyModifier.option.rawValue  != 0 { s += "⌥" }
        if m & HotkeyModifier.shift.rawValue   != 0 { s += "⇧" }
        if m & HotkeyModifier.command.rawValue != 0 { s += "⌘" }
        // Map common kVK codes to printable glyphs (non-exhaustive — covers the default set).
        let keyGlyphs: [UInt32: String] = [
            0x2D: "N", 0x0B: "B", 0x1E: "]", 0x21: "[", 0x08: "C",
            0x18: "=", 0x1B: "-",
        ]
        s += keyGlyphs[b.keyCode] ?? "?\(b.keyCode)"
        return s
    }
}

// HotkeyActionID is declared in Core; add Identifiable conformance here (App-only, for SwiftUI).
extension HotkeyActionID: Identifiable {
    public var id: String { rawValue }
}

// MARK: - Rebind sheet

/// Key-capture sheet: wait for the user to press a key combo, then commit it.
/// Uses an invisible NSView subclass that overrides keyDown to capture the event.
struct RebindSheet: View {
    let actionID: HotkeyActionID
    @ObservedObject var manager: HotkeyManager
    @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss
    @State private var capturedBinding: HotkeyBinding?
    @State private var conflict: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 16) {
            Text("Press a new key combo for:")
            Text(actionID.id.replacingOccurrences(of: "mv.hotkey.", with: ""))
                .font(.headline)
            KeyCaptureView { binding in
                capturedBinding = binding
                conflict = false
            }
            .frame(width: 200, height: 44)
            .overlay(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 8).stroke(Color.accentColor, lineWidth: 1.5))
            if let b = capturedBinding {
                Text("New: \(b.encoded)").font(.caption).foregroundColor(.secondary)
            }
            if conflict {
                Text("That combo is in use by another app.").foregroundColor(.orange).font(.caption)
            }
            HStack {
                Button("Cancel") { dismiss() }
                Spacer()
                Button("Save") {
                    if let b = capturedBinding {
                        let ok = manager.rebind(action: actionID, to: b)
                        if ok { dismiss() } else { conflict = true }
                    }
                }
                .disabled(capturedBinding == nil)
                .keyboardShortcut(.defaultAction)
            }
        }
        .padding(20)
        .frame(width: 340)
    }
}

/// NSViewRepresentable that captures the next key-down event and reports it

    var onCapture: (HotkeyBinding) -> Void

    func makeNSView(context: Context) -> _KeyCaptureNSView {
        let v = _KeyCaptureNSView()
        v.onCapture = onCapture
        return v
    }

    func updateNSView(_ nsView: _KeyCaptureNSView, context: Context) {
        nsView.onCapture = onCapture
    }
}

final class _KeyCaptureNSView: NSView {
    var onCapture: ((HotkeyBinding) -> Void)?

    override var acceptsFirstResponder: Bool { true }

    override func viewDidMoveToWindow() {
        super.viewDidMoveToWindow()
        window?.makeFirstResponder(self)
    }

    override func keyDown(with event: NSEvent) {
        // Ignore bare modifiers; wait for a real key code.
        guard event.keyCode != 0xFF else { return }
        // Adapt NSEvent.ModifierFlags → plain UInt32 mask at the App boundary. The relevant bits
        // (command/option/shift/control) share the same raw values as Core's HotkeyModifier, so
        // the masked rawValue maps 1:1.
        let masked = event.modifierFlags.intersection([.command, .option, .shift, .control])
        let binding = HotkeyBinding(keyCode: UInt32(event.keyCode),
                                    modifiers: UInt32(masked.rawValue))
        onCapture?(binding)
    }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the Hotkeys tab to `SettingsView` and accept `hotkeyManager`**

In `Sources/App/SettingsView.swift`, change `SettingsView` to take the manager and add the tab.
Replace the existing `SettingsView` struct with:

```swift
struct SettingsView: View {
    @ObservedObject var audioModel: AudioModel
    @ObservedObject var hotkeyManager: HotkeyManager

    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            GeneralSettingsView(audioModel: audioModel)
                .tabItem {
                    Label("General", systemImage: "slider.horizontal.3")
                }

            HotkeySettingsView(manager: hotkeyManager)
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Hotkeys", systemImage: "keyboard")
                }

            GuideView()
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Setup Guide", systemImage: "book.pages")
                }
        }
        .padding(20)
        .frame(minWidth: 500, minHeight: 440)
    }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Thread `hotkeyManager` through `ContentView` and `WindowManager`**

In `Sources/App/ContentView.swift` (`ContentView` already has the `hotkeyManager` stored
property from Task 3 — here we start USING it):

1. Update BOTH `openSettings` call sites — the header gear button and the footer Settings
   button — to pass `hotkeyManager`:

```swift
// header gear button
Button {
    WindowManager.openSettings(model: audioModel, hotkeyManager: hotkeyManager)
} label: {
    Image(systemName: "gearshape.fill")
        .font(.system(size: 14))
        .foregroundColor(.secondary)
}
.buttonStyle(.plain)
.help("Settings")
```

```swift
// footer Settings button
Button {
    WindowManager.openSettings(model: audioModel, hotkeyManager: hotkeyManager)
} label: {
    Label("Settings", systemImage: "slider.horizontal.3")
}
.controlSize(.small)
```

2. Update `WindowManager.openSettings` to take and forward `hotkeyManager`:

```swift
static func openSettings(model: AudioModel, hotkeyManager: HotkeyManager) {
    if settingsWindow == nil {
        let view = SettingsView(audioModel: model, hotkeyManager: hotkeyManager)
        let panel = NSPanel(contentRect: NSRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 520, height: 460),
                            styleMask: [.titled, .closable, .miniaturizable, .resizable, .fullSizeContentView],
                            backing: .buffered, defer: false)
        panel.center()
        panel.title = "NoNoise Mac Settings"
        panel.titleVisibility = .hidden
        panel.titlebarAppearsTransparent = true
        panel.contentView = NSHostingView(rootView: view)
        panel.isFloatingPanel = false
        panel.isReleasedWhenClosed = false
        panel.minSize = NSSize(width: 480, height: 420)

        settingsWindow = panel

        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(forName: NSWindow.willCloseNotification, object: panel, queue: nil) { _ in
            settingsWindow = nil
        }
    }
    settingsWindow?.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)
    NSApp.activate(ignoringOtherApps: true)
}
```

> All four touch points — `SettingsView` init, `WindowManager.openSettings`, and the two
> `ContentView` call sites — change together. `NoNoiseMacApp` already passes
> `hotkeyManager: hotkeyManager` into `ContentView(...)` from Task 3.

- [ ] **Step 4: Build**

```bash
swift build
```

Expected: build succeeds.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add Sources/App/SettingsView.swift Sources/App/ContentView.swift
git commit -m "feat(ui): add Hotkeys settings tab + thread hotkeyManager through ContentView/WindowManager"
```

---

## Task 6: A/B Bypass UI indicator in the menu-bar popover

Show a transient "A/B Bypass — hearing raw mic" banner in `ContentView` when bypass is
active, so the user knows they are in passthrough mode.

**Files:**
- Modify: `Sources/App/ContentView.swift`

No XCTest — build + manual.

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm the `dispatcher` property**

`ContentView` already declares `@ObservedObject var dispatcher: ActionDispatcher` (added in
Task 3) and `NoNoiseMacApp` already passes `dispatcher: dispatcher`. This task adds the first
use of `dispatcher.isBypassed` in the body.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the bypass indicator**

Add a `bypassBanner` computed view:

```swift
    @ViewBuilder
    private var bypassBanner: some View {
        if dispatcher.isBypassed {
            HStack(spacing: 8) {
                Image(systemName: "waveform.slash")
                    .foregroundColor(.orange)
                VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 1) {
                    Text("A/B Bypass Active").font(.caption).fontWeight(.medium).foregroundColor(.orange)
                    Text("Hearing raw mic — AI off while bypass is on.")
                        .font(.caption2).foregroundColor(.secondary)
                }
                Spacer()
            }
            .nnCard()
            .transition(.opacity.combined(with: .move(edge: .top)))
        }
    }
```

Add `bypassBanner` to `body`'s `VStack`, immediately after `statusCard`:

```swift
        VStack(spacing: 14) {
            header
            statusCard
            bypassBanner
            modeCard
            // ... rest unchanged
        }
        .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.18), value: dispatcher.isBypassed)
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Route the master toggle through the dispatcher + disable it during bypass (finding #2)**

**Problem:** the popover master toggle currently binds directly to `$audioModel.isAIEnabled`
(`statusCard`). During bypass, `AudioModel.isAIEnabled` is forced `false` by the dispatcher — but
a direct binding lets the user flip the UI toggle and write `isAIEnabled = true` straight onto the
model, re-enabling AI processing WHILE `isBypassed == true`. That bypasses (literally) the
desired-vs-effective rule: the bypass is supposed to be the canonical "hear raw mic" state.

**Fix:** bind the toggle to `dispatcher.aiToggleBinding` (which routes the change through
`.toggleAI`, updating `desiredAI` via the reducer) AND disable it while bypassed so it cannot be
flipped mid-bypass at all. The desired AI on/off is still changeable by hotkey while bypassed
(`.toggleAI` always updates `desiredAI`), so disabling the UI toggle during the (typically
momentary) bypass loses no capability — it only removes the state hole.

In `statusCard`, replace the existing toggle:

```swift
                Toggle("", isOn: $audioModel.isAIEnabled)
                    .labelsHidden()
                    .toggleStyle(.switch)
                    .tint(.green)
```

with:

```swift
                // Route through the dispatcher so a UI flip uses the SAME desired-vs-effective
                // path as the toggle-AI hotkey, and disable it during bypass so the user can't
                // re-enable AI processing against an active A/B bypass (finding #2).
                Toggle("", isOn: dispatcher.aiToggleBinding)
                    .labelsHidden()
                    .toggleStyle(.switch)
                    .tint(.green)
                    .disabled(dispatcher.isBypassed)
                    .help(dispatcher.isBypassed
                          ? "Disabled while A/B bypass is active — release bypass to change AI."
                          : "Toggle Noise Cancellation")
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Build**

```bash
swift build
```

Expected: build succeeds.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add Sources/App/ContentView.swift
git commit -m "feat(ui): show A/B bypass banner + route master toggle through dispatcher (disabled during bypass)"
```

## Task 7: `NoNoiseMacCLI` action verbs

Extend `Sources/CLI/main.swift` with `--action <verb>` to support one-shot control from
shell scripts, Alfred, Automator, or Stream Deck's "Shell" action.

**Files:**
- Modify: `Sources/CLI/main.swift`

No XCTest (CLI bootstrap depends on CoreAudio).

- [ ] **Step 1: Add `--action` flag parsing**

In `Sources/CLI/main.swift`, extend the argument parser and add action handling:

```swift
import Foundation
import AppKit   // NSWorkspace (used by --action verb mode to open nonoisemac:// URLs)
import Core

print("NoNoise Mac CLI 🎙️")

var inputName: String?
var outputName: String?
var gain: Float = 1.0
var actionVerb: String?

var args = CommandLine.arguments
var i = 1
while i < args.count {
    switch args[i] {
    case "--in":
        if i + 1 < args.count { inputName = args[i + 1]; i += 1 }
    case "--out":
        if i + 1 < args.count { outputName = args[i + 1]; i += 1 }
    case "--gain":
        if i + 1 < args.count, let g = Float(args[i + 1]) { gain = g; i += 1 }
    case "--action":
        if i + 1 < args.count { actionVerb = args[i + 1]; i += 1 }
    case "--help":
        print("""
        Usage:
          NoNoiseMacCLI --in <device> --out <device> [--gain <float>]
          NoNoiseMacCLI --action <verb>

        Action verbs (send a one-shot control to the running app via URL scheme):
          toggle         Toggle Noise Cancellation
          bypass         Toggle A/B bypass (passthrough)
          preset-next    Cycle preset forward
          preset-prev    Cycle preset backward
          clarity-next   Cycle Broadcast Voice clarity forward
          gain-up        Nudge output gain up
          gain-down      Nudge output gain down

        URL scheme (Stream Deck / scripting):
          open nonoisemac://toggle
          open nonoisemac://bypass
          open nonoisemac://preset/next
          open nonoisemac://preset/prev
          open nonoisemac://clarity/next
          open nonoisemac://gain/up
          open nonoisemac://gain/down
        """)
        exit(0)
    default:
        break
    }
    i += 1
}

// One-shot action mode: send the verb as a URL open and exit.
// The running .app handles it via the nonoisemac:// URL scheme handler.
if let verb = actionVerb {
    let urlStrings: [String: String] = [
        "toggle":       "nonoisemac://toggle",
        "bypass":       "nonoisemac://bypass",
        "preset-next":  "nonoisemac://preset/next",
        "preset-prev":  "nonoisemac://preset/prev",
        "clarity-next": "nonoisemac://clarity/next",
        "gain-up":      "nonoisemac://gain/up",
        "gain-down":    "nonoisemac://gain/down",
    ]
    guard let urlStr = urlStrings[verb], let url = URL(string: urlStr) else {
        print("Error: Unknown action verb '\(verb)'. Run --help for the list.")
        exit(1)
    }
    // NSWorkspace.open delivers the URL to the registered app (NoNoiseMac.app).
    // This requires the .app to be running; the CLI exits immediately after.
    NSWorkspace.shared.open(url)
    print("Sent action '\(verb)' to NoNoise Mac.")
    exit(0)
}

// Pipeline mode (unchanged)
guard let input = inputName, let output = outputName else {
    print("Error: Missing --in or --out.")
    print("Run --help for usage.")
    exit(1)
}

let model = AudioModel()
RunLoop.main.run(until: Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 1.0))

if let inDev = model.inputDevices.first(where: { $0.localizedName.localizedCaseInsensitiveContains(input) }) {
    print("Selecting Input: \(inDev.localizedName)")
    model.selectedInputDeviceID = inDev.uniqueID
} else {
    print("Error: Input device '\(input)' not found.")
    exit(1)
}

if let outDev = model.outputDevices.first(where: { $0.name.localizedCaseInsensitiveContains(output) }) {
    print("Selecting Output: \(outDev.name)")
    model.selectedOutputDeviceID = outDev.id
} else {
    print("Error: Output device '\(output)' not found.")
    exit(1)
}

model.outputGainValue = gain
model.isAIEnabled = true

print("AI Pipeline Active. Press Ctrl+C to stop.")
RunLoop.main.run()
```

Note: `--action` mode uses `NSWorkspace`, so the code block above adds `import AppKit` at the top
of `main.swift`. The `NoNoiseMacCLI` target links `AppKit` implicitly on macOS; no `Package.swift`
change is needed.

- [ ] **Step 2: Build**

```bash
swift build
```

Expected: build succeeds. The `--action toggle` path calls `NSWorkspace.shared.open(_:)` and
exits; the pipeline path is unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

## Task 8: Documentation (8-Fold Awareness Step 2 + compounding)

**Files:**
- Modify: `README.md`
- Modify: `AGENTS.md` (the repo's `CLAUDE.md` is a **symlink** to `AGENTS.md` — editing
  `AGENTS.md` updates both; do NOT create a separate `CLAUDE.md`)
- Modify: `docs/knowledge/timeline1.md`
- Modify: `docs/knowledge/knowledge1.md`

> **Doc target note:** `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md` is a symlink (verified: `ls -la CLAUDE.md`
> shows `CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md`). All agent-guide edits go in `AGENTS.md`.

- [ ] **Step 1: `README.md`** — add a section after the "🎙️ Broadcast Voice" bullet (added by the broadcast-voice plan):

```markdown
- **⌨️ Global Hotkeys + Stream Deck** — system-wide hotkeys (user-configurable) for every
  control action (toggle AI, A/B bypass, cycle preset, cycle Broadcast Voice, nudge gain), plus
  a `nonoisemac://` URL scheme for Stream Deck "Open" actions or shell scripting.
```

Add a subsection after the Broadcast Voice subsection:

```markdown
### ⌨️ Global Hotkeys + Stream Deck

**Global hotkeys** (default combos use ⌃⌥ to avoid system-shortcut collisions):

| Action | Default |
|---|---|
| Toggle Noise Cancellation | ⌃⌥N |
| A/B Bypass (hold for raw) | ⌃⌥B |
| A/B Bypass (toggle) | ⌃⌥⇧B |
| Preset → Next | ⌃⌥] |
| Preset → Previous | ⌃⌥[ |
| Broadcast Voice → Next | ⌃⌥C |
| Gain + | ⌃⌥= |
| Gain − | ⌃⌥- |

Rebind any hotkey in **Settings → Hotkeys**. If a combo is already in use by another app,
NoNoise Mac shows a conflict warning and leaves that slot unregistered.

**Stream Deck (no SDK required):** Use the Stream Deck "Open" action (or "Website" in Open
mode) with one of these URLs:

```
nonoisemac://toggle
nonoisemac://bypass
nonoisemac://preset/next
nonoisemac://preset/prev
nonoisemac://clarity/next
nonoisemac://gain/up
nonoisemac://gain/down
```

Or from a terminal / shell script: `open nonoisemac://toggle` (or `NoNoiseMacCLI --action toggle`).

**A/B Bypass:** Hold ⌃⌥B to momentarily hear the raw mic (useful for comparing before/after
during a recording). Release to restore AI. ⌃⌥⇧B toggles bypass on/off persistently.
```

Also update the "How it works" Voice Polish bullet so the documented chain order is the merged,
canonical order (presence + de-esser are part of the chain, not omitted). Find this line:

```markdown
- An optional **Voice Polish** chain (high-pass → shelves → compressor → limiter) adds tone
  and leveling for Podcast/Tutorial modes.
```

and replace it with:

```markdown
- An optional **Voice Polish** chain (high-pass → shelves → presence → de-esser → compressor →
  limiter) adds tone, clarity, and leveling for Podcast/Tutorial modes and Broadcast Voice.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: `AGENTS.md`** — add a new section "Control layer (Tier 4)" after the "Voice polish chain (Tier 2)" section:

```markdown
## Control layer (Tier 4) — `Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`, `Sources/App/ActionDispatcher.swift`, `Sources/App/HotkeyManager.swift`

- **Core/App split (so it stays testable):** the PURE models — `ControlAction` (URL/CLI parsers
  + gain constants), `HotkeyActionID`, `HotkeyBinding`, `HotkeyModifier`, `ControlState`, and the
  `ControlReducer` state machine — live in `Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift` and import only
  `Foundation`. The test target depends on `Core` only, so the REAL dispatch logic (bypass
  transitions, desired-vs-effective AI, gain clamping, cycling) is unit-tested via `ControlReducer`
  (`Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/ControlLayerTests.swift`) WITHOUT constructing `AudioModel`.
- `ActionDispatcher` (@MainActor, App) is a thin adapter: it reads a `ControlState` snapshot from
  `AudioModel`, runs `ControlReducer.reduce`, and applies the returned `[ControlMutation]`. It is the
  single dispatch point for all control actions. It is NOT headless-testable (depends on `AudioModel`
  → CoreAudio).
- **NEVER blanket-write AudioModel fields from the dispatcher.** The reducer returns an explicit
  `[ControlMutation]` (`.setAIEffective` / `.setPreset` / `.setClarity` / `.setGain`) naming EXACTLY
  what the action changed; the adapter applies ONLY those. This is load-bearing: `AudioModel`'s knob
  `didSet`s have side effects — writing `outputGainValue` (or suppression/atten) calls
  `onKnobChanged()` which flips a non-`.custom` preset to `.custom`; writing `selectedPreset` re-applies
  the preset's own gain/atten via `applyPreset`. A blanket "write every field back" would (a) demote
  the active preset to Custom on `.toggleAI`, and (b) override a just-applied preset's gain with the
  pre-change value on `.presetNext`. So `.toggleAI`/bypass emit only `.setAIEffective`; `.presetNext/
  prev` emit only `.setPreset` (no trailing gain write); `.gainUp/down` emit `.setGain` (the
  `onKnobChanged()` → `.custom` flip is the INTENDED manual-edit behavior).
- **A/B bypass = desired-vs-effective AI.** `desiredAIEnabled` is the user's intended AI on/off
  ignoring bypass; effective = `desiredAI && !(momentary || toggle bypass)`. `.toggleAI` ALWAYS
  flips `desiredAI` (even while bypassed); on bypass exit, `AudioModel.isAIEnabled` follows the
  current desired value. Firing toggle-AI mid-bypass therefore does NOT turn AI back on against the
  bypass. Bypass state is session-only (never persisted); `desiredAI` mirrors the persisted
  `isAIEnabled`. This is the only place `isAIEnabled` is written from outside its `didSet` path.
- **The popover master toggle binds to `dispatcher.aiToggleBinding`, NOT `$audioModel.isAIEnabled`,
  and is `.disabled(dispatcher.isBypassed)`.** A direct binding would let the user flip the UI toggle
  during bypass and write `isAIEnabled = true` straight onto the model, re-enabling AI against an
  active bypass (the desired-vs-effective rule's state hole). Routing through the dispatcher uses the
  same `.toggleAI` path; disabling it during bypass closes the hole (desired AI is still changeable by
  hotkey while bypassed).
- `HotkeyManager` (@MainActor, App) uses Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` + `InstallEventHandler`.
  **Do NOT switch to `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents`** — that requires Accessibility permission,
  violating the minimal-entitlement policy (AGENTS.md "Entitlements & signing"). Carbon hotkeys work
  with the existing two entitlements and no permission prompt.
- **Hotkeys register at app launch**, in `NoNoiseMacApp.init()` (HotkeyManager held on `@StateObject`),
  NOT in `ContentView.onAppear` — a `MenuBarExtra`'s content view isn't instantiated until the
  popover opens, so onAppear-registration would leave hotkeys dead until first click.
- **`appDelegate.dispatcher` is wired in `NoNoiseMacApp.init()`, NOT `ContentView.onAppear`** (same
  MenuBarExtra timing reason). The `@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor` wrapped value exists before the
  `init()` body runs, so the assignment is valid there. Wiring in `onAppear` would leave the
  AppDelegate's `application(_:open:)` URL fallback with a nil dispatcher until the popover first
  opened — a bundled `.app` would drop `open nonoisemac://…` fired before any popover open.
- **`EventHotKeyID.id` is deterministic** (`HotkeyActionID.allCases` index + 1), NOT
  `rawValue.hashValue` — Swift's `hashValue` is randomized per process and would make the fired ID
  un-matchable back to its action.
- The Carbon C callback extracts the `EventHotKeyID` synchronously, then hops to the main actor via
  `Task { @MainActor in … }` before touching `HotkeyManager`/`ActionDispatcher` (both `@MainActor`).
- `HotkeyBinding` stores a plain `UInt32` modifier mask (Core `HotkeyModifier` bits, which equal the
  AppKit `NSEvent.ModifierFlags` device-independent bits). Core never imports AppKit; `HotkeyManager`
  / `KeyCaptureView` adapt `NSEvent.ModifierFlags` ↔ `UInt32` at the App boundary. Encodes as
  `"<keyCode>:<modifierMask>"`.
- Bindings persist under `mv.hotkey.*` keys (consistent with the existing `mv.*` namespace).
- If `RegisterEventHotKey` returns `eventHotKeyExistsErr` (-9878), the slot is left unregistered and
  surfaced in `conflictedActions` (shown in Settings → Hotkeys). Never crash.
- Gain nudge clamps to `0.5...4.0` — the SAME range as the Settings → General "Output Gain" slider
  (`SettingsView.gainCard`). Keep these in sync if the slider range ever changes.
- `nonoisemac://` URL scheme is registered in `Resources/Info.plist` (`CFBundleURLTypes`).
  **This only works in a bundled `.app`** — `swift run` / `swift build` do not register URL schemes.
  Test via `./bundle.sh` + opening `NoNoiseMac.app`.
```

> **Voice-chain order in this section / any docs you touch:** use the canonical merged order
> `hp → shelves → presence → deEsser → comp → limiter` (matching the existing "Voice polish chain
> (Tier 2)" entry). Do not document a truncated `hp → shelves → comp → limiter` that omits the
> Broadcast Voice clarity stages.

- [ ] **Step 3: `docs/knowledge/timeline1.md`** — append:

```markdown
## 2026-06-15 — Control layer (global hotkeys + A/B bypass + Stream Deck) added

Added the pure control models + `ControlReducer` to `Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`
(`ControlAction`, `HotkeyActionID`, `HotkeyBinding`, `HotkeyModifier`, `ControlState`,
`ControlMutation`) so the real dispatch logic is unit-tested headlessly without `AudioModel`.
The reducer returns `(ControlState, [ControlMutation])`; `ActionDispatcher` (Sources/App) applies
ONLY the emitted mutations onto a live `AudioModel` — never a blanket field write-back, which would
re-trip the knob `didSet`s (writing `outputGainValue` flips a preset to `.custom`; writing
`selectedPreset` re-applies the preset's own gain). So `.toggleAI` no longer demotes the active
preset to Custom and `.presetNext` keeps the preset-defined gain. `HotkeyManager` (Sources/App)
registers system-wide Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` combos (default ⌃⌥ set, deterministic
`EventHotKeyID`s) with UserDefaults persistence under `mv.hotkey.*`; created at app launch in
`NoNoiseMacApp.init()` so hotkeys are live before the popover opens (and `appDelegate.dispatcher`
is wired in `init()` too, so the URL fallback works pre-popover). `nonoisemac://` URL scheme
registered in `Resources/Info.plist`. A/B bypass uses a desired-vs-effective AI model: while
bypassed, AI is forced off and toggle-AI updates the DESIRED state (restored on bypass exit) —
never persisted; the popover master toggle routes through the dispatcher and is disabled during
bypass so AI can't be re-enabled against an active bypass. Gain nudge clamps to the slider's
`0.5...4.0`. `NoNoiseMacCLI` extended with `--action <verb>`.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: `docs/knowledge/knowledge1.md`** — append a `[DECISION]` entry:

```markdown
## 2026-06-15 — [DECISION] Carbon RegisterEventHotKey over NSEvent global monitors (@<username>)

**Problem**: System-wide hotkeys for a backgrounded menu-bar app.
**Decision**: Use Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` + `InstallEventHandler`. It works under the
hardened runtime with the existing two entitlements (no new entitlement, no Accessibility
prompt). `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents` is the SwiftUI-friendly alternative but requires
Accessibility permission — violating the minimal-entitlement policy.
**Rule**: Never add Accessibility permission for hotkey capture in this app. If global key
monitoring is ever needed beyond registered combos, revisit and document the permission impact.
**Files**: `Sources/App/HotkeyManager.swift`, `Resources/NoNoiseMac.entitlements`

## 2026-06-15 — [PATTERN] Pure reducer in Core makes the control layer testable (@<username>)

**Problem**: The test target depends on `Core` only; `AudioModel.init()` starts CoreAudio so it
is not headless-testable. Putting control logic in `Sources/App` (consumed via `@testable import
Core`) would be untestable and would not even compile from tests.
**Decision**: Keep the PURE models + a `ControlReducer` over a value-type `ControlState` in
`Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`. `ActionDispatcher` (App) is a thin adapter (read state from
`AudioModel` → reduce → write back). Tests exercise the reducer directly — no test-only branches.
**Rule**: Any control/state logic that must be tested goes in `Core` as a pure function over a
value type; the App layer only adapts it onto live objects. Never put testable logic in `App`.
**Files**: `Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`, `Sources/App/ActionDispatcher.swift`,
`Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/ControlLayerTests.swift`

## 2026-06-15 — [GOTCHA] A/B bypass needs desired-vs-effective AI state (@<username>)

**Problem**: Naïvely saving `isAIEnabled` on bypass entry and restoring on exit breaks if the user
toggles AI WHILE bypassed: the toggle flips the forced-off live value, then bypass exit clobbers it
back to the pre-bypass value — the toggle is lost.
**Root Cause**: A single `isAIEnabled` field conflated "what the user wants" with "what's playing".
**Fix**: Separate `desiredAI` (what the user wants, flipped by `.toggleAI` always) from effective AI
(`desiredAI && !bypassed`, written to `AudioModel.isAIEnabled`). Bypass exit recomputes effective
from the CURRENT desired value. See `ControlReducer` + the bypass-sequence tests.
**Rule**: When a transient override (bypass) suppresses a user-settable flag, store the user's
desired value separately and recompute the effective value — don't save/restore the live value.
**Files**: `Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`, `Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/ControlLayerTests.swift`

## 2026-06-15 — [GOTCHA] Carbon EventHotKeyID must be deterministic, not hashValue (@<username>)

**Problem**: Building `EventHotKeyID.id` from `action.rawValue.hashValue` makes the fired hotkey
ID un-matchable: Swift's `String.hashValue` is randomized per process, so the value used at
registration differs from naive reconstruction and the event can't be routed back to its action.
**Fix**: Derive the numeric ID from the action's index in `HotkeyActionID.allCases` (+1, never 0).
Also: the Carbon C callback must not call a `@MainActor` method synchronously — extract the
`EventHotKeyID` in the callback, then hop via `Task { @MainActor in … }`.
**Rule**: Carbon `EventHotKeyID`s must be stable, deterministic small integers; bridge C callbacks
to the main actor explicitly instead of assuming the calling thread.
**Files**: `Sources/App/HotkeyManager.swift`

## 2026-06-15 — [GOTCHA] Dispatcher must apply explicit mutations, never blanket-write AudioModel (@<username>)

**Problem**: An `ActionDispatcher` that pushed the whole reduced state back onto `AudioModel` every
dispatch (`model.outputGainValue = state.gain`, `model.selectedPreset = state.preset`, …) corrupted
preset state. `AudioModel.outputGainValue.didSet` calls `onKnobChanged()`, which flips a non-`.custom`
preset to `.custom` — so even `.toggleAI` (which never touches gain) demoted Meeting/Podcast/Tutorial
to Custom. Worse, `.presetNext` wrote `selectedPreset` (whose `didSet` → `applyPreset` sets the
preset's gain/atten) and THEN wrote the pre-change `state.gain` back, overriding the preset gain and
re-flipping to Custom.
**Root Cause**: `AudioModel`'s `@Published` knobs are NOT inert setters — their `didSet`s mutate
preset state. Writing an unchanged field is not a no-op.
**Fix**: `ControlReducer.reduce` returns `(ControlState, [ControlMutation])`. Each mutation
(`.setAIEffective`/`.setPreset`/`.setClarity`/`.setGain`) names exactly one changed field; the adapter
applies ONLY those. `.toggleAI`/bypass → `.setAIEffective` only; `.presetNext/prev` → `.setPreset`
only (no trailing gain write — the preset owns its gain); `.gainUp/down` → `.setGain` (the
`onKnobChanged()` → `.custom` flip is the intended manual-edit behavior).
**Rule**: When adapting a pure reducer onto a stateful object whose setters have side effects, emit
an explicit list of changed fields and write only those — never blanket-write the full snapshot.
**Files**: `Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`, `Sources/App/ActionDispatcher.swift`,
`Tests/NoNoiseMacTests/ControlLayerTests.swift`

## 2026-06-15 — [GOTCHA] Bypass-safe AI must gate the UI toggle, not just the dispatcher (@<username>)

**Problem**: The desired-vs-effective AI rule is only canonical for dispatcher actions. The popover
master toggle bound directly to `$audioModel.isAIEnabled`, so during bypass a user could flip the UI
toggle and write `isAIEnabled = true` straight onto the model — re-enabling AI processing while
`isBypassed == true`, defeating the bypass.
**Fix**: Bind the toggle to `dispatcher.aiToggleBinding` (routes through `.toggleAI`) and
`.disabled(dispatcher.isBypassed)`. Desired AI is still changeable by hotkey while bypassed.
**Rule**: Any UI control that writes a field also owned by a transient-override state machine must go
through that machine (or be disabled while the override is active) — a direct binding is a back door.
**Files**: `Sources/App/ContentView.swift`, `Sources/App/ActionDispatcher.swift`
```

## Manual smoke test (after all tasks)

### Prerequisites

```bash
./bundle.sh          # build and sign the .app
open NoNoiseMac.app  # install+open (or ./install-app.sh)
```

### Hotkey tests

0. **Hotkeys live before popover open (regression for the onAppear bug):** Launch the app and DO
   NOT click the menu-bar icon. With focus in another app (e.g. TextEdit), press ⌃⌥N. The menu-bar
   icon must change state (AI off ↔ on) WITHOUT ever opening the popover. If nothing happens until
   the popover is first opened, the HotkeyManager is being created in `ContentView.onAppear` instead
   of `NoNoiseMacApp.init()` — fix Task 3.
0b. **URL fallback live before popover open (finding #3):** Launch the bundled `.app` and DO NOT
   click the menu-bar icon. In Terminal run `open nonoisemac://toggle`. AI must toggle (menu-bar
   icon state flips) even though the popover has never opened. If nothing happens, `appDelegate
   .dispatcher` is still being wired in `ContentView.onAppear` instead of `NoNoiseMacApp.init()`
   — fix Task 3.
1. Open the popover. Confirm **Noise Cancellation** toggle reflects the current state.
2. Press ⌃⌥N (default toggle). Confirm the toggle flips; press again, confirm it flips back.
3. Hold ⌃⌥B — the popover (if open) shows the orange A/B Bypass banner; AI is heard as raw mic.
   Release — banner disappears, AI resumes at its pre-bypass value.
4. Press ⌃⌥⇧B — bypass toggles ON (banner). Press again — bypass toggles OFF.
5. **Desired-vs-effective regression:** With AI ON, hold ⌃⌥B (bypass on, raw mic), and WHILE holding
   press ⌃⌥N (toggle). Release ⌃⌥B. Confirm AI stays OFF (the toggle won) — it must NOT snap back ON.
5b. **Master toggle gated during bypass (finding #2):** Open the popover. Activate bypass (⌃⌥⇧B or
   hold ⌃⌥B). The header master toggle must be DISABLED (greyed out) while bypass is active — you
   cannot click it to turn AI back on against the bypass. Release/clear bypass; the toggle is
   enabled again and reflects the desired AI state.
6. **Preset cycling preserves the preset's gain + does NOT flip to Custom (finding #1):** Note the
   current preset and gain (Settings → General). Press ⌃⌥] — the preset advances to the NEXT preset
   (e.g. Meeting → Podcast), the Mode segmented control lands on that preset (NOT "Custom"), and the
   gain shows the NEW preset's gain (not the previous value). Press ⌃⌥[ — preset retreats, same
   rules. If cycling lands on "Custom" or keeps the old gain, the adapter is blanket-writing
   `outputGainValue` — fix Task 2 (`ActionDispatcher.dispatch` must apply only the reducer's
   `[ControlMutation]`).
6c. **toggleAI does NOT change the preset (finding #1):** Select a non-Custom preset (e.g. Podcast).
   Press ⌃⌥N twice (toggle AI off then on). The Mode control must STILL show Podcast — toggling AI
   must never demote the preset to "Custom".
7. Press ⌃⌥C — Broadcast Voice clarity cycles.
8. Press ⌃⌥= and ⌃⌥- — observe gain going up/down in Settings; confirm it never exceeds 4.0 or drops below 0.5.

### Settings → Hotkeys tab

9. Open Settings. A **Hotkeys** tab appears.
10. Confirm all 8 bindings are listed with their default combos.
11. Click **Edit** on one binding, press a new combo (e.g. ⌃⌥⇧N), click **Save**.
12. Quit and relaunch — confirm the rebound combo is restored (persistence via `mv.hotkey.*`).
13. Try binding to a combo already in use by another app — confirm the slot shows the conflict warning and the old hotkey no longer fires.

### URL scheme (Stream Deck path)

> URL-scheme registration only works in the bundled `.app` — not in `swift run`.

14. With `NoNoiseMac.app` running: `open nonoisemac://toggle` in Terminal. Confirm AI toggles.
15. `open nonoisemac://bypass` — confirm bypass activates (orange banner if popover is open).
16. `open nonoisemac://preset/next` — confirm preset cycles.
17. `open nonoisemac://clarity/next` — confirm Broadcast Voice cycles.
18. `open nonoisemac://gain/up` — confirm gain increases.
19. **Stream Deck:** Add a "Open" button → URL → `nonoisemac://toggle`. Press the button on the Stream Deck. Confirm AI toggles.

### CLI action mode

20. (Requires the `.app` to be running and registered): `./NoNoiseMacCLI --action toggle` — confirm AI toggles.
21. `./NoNoiseMacCLI --action preset-next` — confirm preset cycles.
22. `./NoNoiseMacCLI --help` — confirm the Stream Deck URL reference and verb list are printed.

### Persistence

23. Set a non-default preset, toggle bypass, quit and relaunch. Confirm:
    - Preset restored correctly.
    - Bypass is NOT restored (it is session-only, not persisted).
    - `isAIEnabled` is restored to its desired (pre-bypass) value — the persisted preference is correct because bypass never persists, and `desiredAI` mirrors it.

### Regression

24. With all features off (AI on, default preset, clarity off, no bypass), confirm the audio output is byte-for-byte equivalent to a build without this feature (the control layer only dispatches; it has no DSP path of its own).

## Self-Review (completed during authoring)

- **Entitlement impact:** Zero. Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` works with the existing two keys.
  No third key added. `nonoisemac://` URL scheme is a `Info.plist` declaration, not an
  entitlement. `NSEvent` global monitors are explicitly NOT used.
- **Hotkey API choice documented:** Carbon vs NSEvent tradeoff explained in context section,
  in `HotkeyManager.swift` inline comment, and in `AGENTS.md`. No ambiguity left for future agents.
- **URL-scheme SwiftPM caveat documented:** Task 4 Step 3 note + smoke test calls it out.
  `swift run` will NOT register the scheme; only the bundled `.app` will.
- **A/B bypass = desired-vs-effective:** `desiredAI` is separate from effective AI; `.toggleAI`
  always flips desired (even while bypassed); bypass exit recomputes effective from current desired.
  Bypass is session-only. Verified by `ControlReducer` tests (bypass↓→toggle→bypass↑, overlap,
  bypass+preset) and smoke-test steps 5 + 23.
- **Explicit mutation list — no preset corruption (round-3 critical fix #1):** `ControlReducer.reduce`
  returns `(ControlState, [ControlMutation])`; `ActionDispatcher.dispatch` applies ONLY the emitted
  mutations, never a blanket write of `outputGainValue`/`selectedPreset`/`clarityLevel`. `.toggleAI`
  and bypass emit only `.setAIEffective`; `.presetNext/prev` emit only `.setPreset` (no trailing gain
  write — `AudioModel.applyPreset` owns the preset's gain); `.gainUp/down` emit `.setGain` (the
  `onKnobChanged()` → `.custom` flip is intended for a manual nudge). Reducer-mutation tests assert
  toggleAI doesn't change preset, presetNext keeps the preset gain (no `.setGain`), and gain hotkeys
  emit `.setGain`. Smoke-test steps 6, 6c verify in the running app.
- **Master toggle gated during bypass (round-3 fix #2):** the popover master toggle binds to
  `dispatcher.aiToggleBinding` (routes through `.toggleAI`) and is `.disabled(dispatcher.isBypassed)`
  — a user can no longer flip the UI toggle to re-enable AI against an active bypass. Smoke-test
  step 5b verifies. Desired AI stays changeable by hotkey while bypassed.
- **AppDelegate dispatcher wired at launch (round-3 fix #3):** `appDelegate.dispatcher = dispatcher`
  moved from `ContentView.onAppear` into `NoNoiseMacApp.init()`, so the URL-scheme fallback
  (`application(_:open:)`) has a dispatcher before the popover ever opens. Smoke-test step 0b verifies
  `open nonoisemac://toggle` works pre-popover in the bundled `.app`.
- **Testability (reviewer fix #1/#6):** the pure models + `ControlReducer` live in `Sources/Core`
  (test target depends on `Core` only) and the REAL dispatch logic is unit-tested via the reducer —
  no `AudioModel`, no test-only branches. `HotkeyBinding` stores a plain `UInt32` mask, adapted to
  `NSEvent.ModifierFlags` only at the App boundary.
- **Launch-time hotkey registration (reviewer fix #2):** `HotkeyManager` is created in
  `NoNoiseMacApp.init()` (held on `@StateObject`), not in `ContentView.onAppear` — hotkeys are live
  before the popover is ever opened. Smoke-test step 0 guards this.
- **Compilation correctness (reviewer fix #3):** `ActionDispatcher` + `HotkeyManager` both conform
  to `ObservableObject`; `import AppKit`/`Combine`/`Carbon.HIToolbox` present; the Carbon C callback
  hops to the main actor via `Task { @MainActor in … }`; `EventHotKeyID`s are deterministic
  (`allCases` index + 1), not `hashValue`.
- **Gain bounds (reviewer fix #7):** clamp range is `0.5...4.0`, matching the Settings slider.
- **`mv.*` namespace preserved:** All new persistence keys use `mv.hotkey.*` (consistent with
  the existing `mv.preset`, `mv.suppressionStrength`, etc.).
- **No MetalVoice/Ghostkwebb in Sources/:** New files are `Sources/Core/ControlLayer.swift`,
  `Sources/App/ActionDispatcher.swift`, `Sources/App/HotkeyManager.swift` — all branded identifiers.
- **Render thread untouched:** `ActionDispatcher.dispatch` writes to `AudioModel`'s
  `@Published` properties on the main thread — the same pattern as the existing `outputGainValue`
  knob. No new lock or synchronisation primitive needed.
- **Docs target (reviewer fix #8):** agent-guide edits go in `AGENTS.md` (`CLAUDE.md` is its
  symlink); voice-chain order documented as the merged `hp → shelves → presence → deEsser → comp →
  limiter`.
- **Threading completeness (reviewer fix #5):** Task 5 updates `SettingsView`, `WindowManager.openSettings`,
  the `ContentView` property, and BOTH `openSettings` call sites in one commit (`SettingsView.swift`
  + `ContentView.swift`).
- **CLI imports (minor fix):** the Task 7 `main.swift` code block now includes `import AppKit` in the
  block itself (it uses `NSWorkspace`), not only in a trailing note — the code is self-contained.
- **Placeholder scan:** No placeholders. All code shown is complete and copy-pasteable.
- **Type consistency:** `ControlAction`, `ControlReducer`, `ControlState`, `ControlMutation`,
  `HotkeyBinding`, `HotkeyActionID`, `HotkeyModifier`, `HotkeyManager`, `ActionDispatcher`,
  `KeyCaptureView`, `RebindSheet`, `HotkeySettingsView` used consistently across tasks.
  `ControlReducer.reduce` returns `(state:, mutations:)` and ALL call sites (tests + adapter)
  destructure it. `HotkeyActionID` conforms to `Identifiable` in the UI task where needed.

## Post-Implementation Amendments

Applied after the post-implementation Codex code review (gpt-5.5, approved round 2). Each item
below was a **plan gap** — the implementation followed the plan as written; the plan simply
didn't constrain the area, so the review caught it. Recorded here so the plan stays an accurate
learning artifact.

- **[PLAN GAP] CLI verb→URL had no single source of truth (test-vs-runtime divergence).**
  Task 7 added `ControlAction.from(cliVerb:)` to Core (tested) AND a separate `nonoisemac://`
  URL string in the CLI's `main.swift`. The plan never required the CLI's *emitted URL* to derive
  from the same canonical mapping the URL handler parses, so `main.swift` shipped a private
  `urlStrings` dictionary that no test exercised — free to drift from `from(url:)`.
  **Fix applied:** added `ControlAction.urlString` (Core) as the canonical URL emitter (nil for
  hotkey-only momentary bypass); the CLI now resolves `--action` via `from(cliVerb:)` → `urlString`;
  added a `testCLIVerbToURLRoundTrips()` round-trip test (verb → action → URL → action).
  **Root cause:** the plan treated "parse a verb" and "emit a URL" as separate concerns instead of
  one round-trippable contract. Future control-surface plans should require a single canonical
  encoder + a round-trip test whenever a value is both parsed and emitted.

- **[PLAN GAP] Hotkey registration error handling under-specified.**
  The plan said failed registrations surface in `conflictedActions` for rebinding, but didn't
  distinguish the expected conflict (`eventHotKeyExistsErr`, -9878) from unexpected `OSStatus`
  failures, nor require logging the latter.
  **Fix applied:** `HotkeyManager.register` now logs any non-`eventHotKeyExistsErr` status (so a
  malformed key code isn't invisible) while still inserting every failure into `conflictedActions`.

- **[IMPLEMENTATION, not plan] Unused `@State isListeningForKey`** in `HotkeySettingsView` was a
  leftover from drafting; removed. Not a plan gap.
