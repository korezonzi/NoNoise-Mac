# Input Volume & Smart Level Plan

**Goal:** Fix hot-mic distortion where normal speech sounds too loud, hits the ceiling, or becomes
harsh after NoNoise processing. Ship a macOS-familiar **Input Volume** control first, then add
low-cost clipping detection and an optional **Smart Level** mode that protects the signal by reducing
gain when the voice repeatedly approaches the ceiling.

**Naming decision:** User-facing UI says **Input Volume**, matching macOS Sound Settings language.
Internally this is an app-level pre-DSP trim, not a write to the global macOS hardware input volume.
That keeps NoNoise reversible, per-app, privacy-safe, and predictable across USB/Bluetooth/built-in
mics. If a later release adds true hardware volume writes, it should be a separate explicit option.

**Relationship to the Metering & Loudness plan:** This is the fast, protective hot-mic guard. The
larger `docs/plans/2026-06-15-metering-and-loudness.md` plan still owns full LUFS metering,
normalization targets, and the richer HUD. This plan may reuse the same telemetry shape later, but
does not require BS.1770 or LUFS work to fix clipping.

## Current Code Facts

- `SettingsView` currently exposes **Output Gain** only, with a `0.5...4.0` range.
- `AudioModel.captureOutput(...)` converts the real mic to 48 kHz mono and writes samples directly
  into `ringBuffer`.
- `DeepFilterNetDSP.outputGain` is applied inside the DSP output path.
- `VoiceChain` can add compressor makeup, presence, and limiting after DSP.
- The existing limiter prevents numeric overflow, but a hot input can still sound crushed or harsh
  because the signal is already too close to full scale before/through processing.
- `AudioModel.inputLevel` is currently an RMS-ish visual meter, not a clip detector.

## Product Behavior

### Manual Input Volume

Add a Settings control named **Input Volume**.

- Range: `25%...100%`
- Default: `100%`
- Reset button: `Reset to 100%`
- Persisted key: `mv.inputVolume`
- Applies before writing converted mic samples into `ringBuffer`
- Does not change macOS system input volume
- Does not alter default sound when left at `100%`

Recommended UI copy:

> Lowers your mic before NoNoise processing. Use this if your voice sounds clipped, crushed, or too
> loud even when speaking normally.

### Peak & Clip Detection

Track cheap sample peaks with scalar math only.

- Input peak: measured after conversion and after Input Volume trim, before `ringBuffer.write`.
- Output peak: measured in the render callback after DSP + `VoiceChain`.
- Near-ceiling threshold: `0.98`
- Clip threshold: `0.999`
- Publish lightweight state:
  - `inputPeak`
  - `outputPeak`
  - `isInputNearCeiling`
  - `isOutputClipping`
- UI should surface concise warnings:
  - `Input too loud`
  - `Output clipping`

For v1, this is **sample-peak**, not oversampled true-peak. Do not label it dBTP.

### Smart Level

Add a toggle named **Smart Level**.

Smart Level is protective, not a loudness maximizer. It should reduce gain when the signal is too
hot, but it should not boost quiet users automatically in this phase.

Behavior:

- If input repeatedly exceeds the near-ceiling threshold, reduce **Input Volume** gradually.
- If output clips while input is not near ceiling, reduce **Output Gain** gradually.
- Prefer reducing Input Volume when input is hot; prefer reducing Output Gain when processing/output
  is the source of clipping.
- Never increase Input Volume automatically.
- Never make sudden jumps.
- Clamp automatic Input Volume reduction to a sane floor, recommended `35%`.
- Let the user manually set lower than the Smart Level floor if needed.
- Show the adjustment in UI text, e.g. `Smart Level reduced Input Volume to 78%`.

Suggested adjustment rule:

- Maintain small counters for consecutive hot windows.
- On every UI/meter tick, if a counter crosses the threshold, reduce the relevant control by about
  `1 dB`.
- Clear or decay counters when the signal returns below threshold.
- Minimum interval between automatic changes: about `300...500 ms`.

## Architecture

### AudioModel State

Add:

```swift
@Published public var inputVolumeValue: Float = 1.0
@Published public var smartLevelEnabled: Bool = false
@Published public var inputPeak: Float = 0.0
@Published public var outputPeak: Float = 0.0
@Published public var isInputNearCeiling: Bool = false
@Published public var isOutputClipping: Bool = false
@Published public var smartLevelMessage: String?
```

Add persistence keys:

```swift
static let inputVolume = "mv.inputVolume"
static let smartLevel = "mv.smartLevel"
```

Use the existing `isApplyingPreset` guard pattern for persistence side effects.

### Input Volume Application

Apply Input Volume in `captureOutput(...)`, after conversion and before metering/ring write.

Implementation shape:

```swift
let inputVolume = inputVolumeValue
if inputVolume != 1 {
    vDSP_vsmul(floatData, 1, [inputVolume], floatData, 1, vDSP_Length(convertedFrames))
}
```

Use the correct Swift form for the scalar pointer; avoid allocating inside the hot path. A local
`var volume = inputVolumeValue` passed to `vDSP_vsmul` is acceptable.

### Telemetry

Keep telemetry cheap:

- Scalar loop over the converted input buffer for input RMS/peak.
- Scalar loop over the render output buffer for output RMS/peak/clip.
- Avoid per-buffer `DispatchQueue.main.async`; prefer lock-free scalar snapshots and a modest UI
  timer if implementing both input and output meters together.

If execution scope is kept smaller, input peak can update with the existing input-level path first,
then move to the shared timer when the larger metering plan lands.

### Smart Level Adjustment

Add a main-thread method:

```swift
private func updateSmartLevel()
```

It reads the published/snapshotted peak state and adjusts controls gradually:

- Input hot repeatedly: `inputVolumeValue = max(inputVolumeValue * dbToLinear(-1), 0.35)`
- Output clipping repeatedly: `outputGainValue = max(outputGainValue * dbToLinear(-1), 0.25)`

Do not run adjustment logic on the render thread.

## Tests

Prefer pure tests where possible.

Add a pure helper if useful:

```swift
struct SmartLevelController {
    static func nextInputVolume(...)
    static func nextOutputGain(...)
}
```

Test cases:

- Input Volume default is unity.
- Input Volume scales samples before ring write behavior is wired.
- Smart Level reduces Input Volume after repeated hot input windows.
- Smart Level does not reduce from a single isolated peak.
- Smart Level reduces Output Gain when output clips but input is not hot.
- Smart Level never boosts Input Volume automatically.
- Smart Level respects the automatic floor.

AudioModel orchestration remains build/manual-smoke verified because initializing it starts
CoreAudio/AVFoundation.

## Manual Smoke Test

1. Install/run the app.
2. Select the real mic as input and `NoNoise Mic` in the recording app.
3. Speak normally with Input Volume at `100%`; observe whether warning appears.
4. Lower Input Volume to `70...80%`; confirm the recorded voice is less crushed.
5. Turn Smart Level on and speak loudly; confirm Input Volume steps down slowly, not abruptly.
6. With input no longer hot, raise Output Gain until output clips; confirm Smart Level reduces
   Output Gain instead.
7. Quit/relaunch; confirm Input Volume and Smart Level restore.
