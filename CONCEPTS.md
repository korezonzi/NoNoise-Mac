# Concepts — NoNoise Mac domain vocabulary

Shared language for humans and agents. Use these terms consistently in code, commits,
docs, and reviews.

## Product
- **NoNoise Mac** — the macOS menu-bar app (this project). Identifier `NoNoiseMac`.
- **Passthrough** — AI off: input is routed to output unprocessed (gain only).
- **Preset / Mode** — a named bundle of suppression + polish settings: `Meeting`,
  `Podcast`, `Tutorial`, `Custom`. Source of truth: `VoicePreset`.
- **Virtual cable** — a loopback audio device (e.g. BlackHole 2ch) used as NoNoise Mac's
  output so other apps can select it as their input.

## Signal pipeline
- **Capture → Ring buffer → Render callback → DSP → Voice polish → Output.**
- **Ring buffer** — lock-light FIFO decoupling capture from the render thread
  (`RingBuffer`); spectral feature history uses `SpecHistoryRingBuffer`.
- **Render thread** — the real-time AVAudioEngine callback. Allocation-free; scalar/vDSP
  math only. See `AGENTS.md` → Real-time audio rules.

## DSP / DeepFilterNet
- **DeepFilterNet3 (DFN)** — the noise-suppression neural model (stock), run via CoreML on
  the Neural Engine/GPU (`computeUnits = .all`).
- **STFT / ISTFT** — short-time Fourier transform and its inverse. fft 960, hop 480,
  481 bins.
- **wnorm** — analysis window normalization `1/960`. The model's input/output spectra live
  in this scale; never blend across scales or de-normalize the output.
- **OLA (overlap-add)** — synthesis reconstruction; the Vorbis window gives unity OLA
  (Princen–Bradley).
- **ERB bands** — 32 perceptual frequency bands partitioning the 481 bins; a DFN input
  feature (`feat_erb`).
- **feat_spec** — first 96 unit-normed complex bins; a DFN input feature.
- **Hidden state** — recurrent model state (`h_enc/h_erb/h_df`) carried across hops.

## Suppression controls
- **Suppression Strength** — wet/dry mix `0…1` (`DeepFilterNetDSP.suppressionStrength`).
- **Reduction Limit (attenuation limit, dB)** — caps how far a bin may be reduced so the
  voice keeps natural tone; `>= maxAttenuationDb` means unlimited.
- **minGain / resolveOutputBin** — pure, unit-tested helpers implementing the blend math.

## Voice polish (Tier 2)
- **Voice Polish / VoiceChain** — post-DSP shaping: high-pass → low-shelf → high-shelf →
  compressor → limiter. Off in Meeting; on in Podcast/Tutorial/Custom.
- **Biquad** — RBJ-cookbook second-order IIR filter (TDF-II).
- **Compressor** — log-domain feed-forward dynamics (threshold/ratio/attack/release/makeup).
- **Limiter** — fast peak limiter + hard clamp; the final overflow guard (ceiling dB).
